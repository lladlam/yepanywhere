# Memory-growth notes

## Browser-tab lifetime memory

- **2026-07-28 long-session observation and goal.** One long-lived session tab
  reached roughly 5 GB of browser-process memory; reloading the same session
  returned it to roughly 200 MB. This delta is not by itself proof of a JS,
  DOM, or native leak—the browser may retain useful history, caches, rendered
  resources, or allocator high-water—but it is direct evidence that the
  long-lived default scales much worse than a fresh equivalent view and leaves
  substantial efficiency headroom.

  The out-of-box goal is for a continuously open session to converge toward
  reload-like memory without requiring the reader to choose a manual “start at
  this turn” boundary. Very old content should automatically **freeze** into a
  lightweight semantic placeholder/window boundary once it is outside the
  active reading neighborhood, then **revive transparently** from canonical
  session data when the reader scrolls, searches, follows an anchor, or
  otherwise navigates back to it. Freezing must release unreachable render
  trees, highlighted HTML, media/object URLs, message-owned augments, and other
  content-proportional client state while preserving order, stable anchors,
  pagination, comments, and scroll restoration. Manual tail/start controls
  remain useful overrides and diagnostics, not the normal memory-management
  requirement.

  Investigation should compare settled live-tab and post-reload samples using
  browser-process memory alongside JS heap, DOM/row counts, retained
  session-store bytes, route snapshots, highlighted/media resources, and active
  object URLs. Quiescence-gate measurements so load-time highlighting and
  streaming bursts are not mislabeled as retained growth.
- **2026-07-28 fresh-view probe.** A two-minute instrumented reload of the
  reported long session did not reproduce retained JS or DOM growth:
  `usedJSHeapSize` stayed at the browser's reported 123 MB, while the rendered
  view stayed at 235 message rows, 90 tool rows, and 6,330 DOM nodes. The
  bounded initial request returned 330 messages from a 3,877-message session,
  so the former missing-tail/full-history fallback did not recur. This probe
  could not attach to the already-grown browser process and therefore does not
  disprove the observed 5 GB lifetime high-water or identify its native
  retained categories.

  The same probe did find continuing avoidable work: while public sharing is
  enabled, the session page polls its 82-byte viewer-status response every five
  seconds and replaces page state even when the response is unchanged. Each
  poll coincided with another broad style/reconciliation cycle on this large
  page. That is an allocation/layout-churn lead, not evidence that those
  allocations remain live; it is tracked separately in
  [`gaps/public-share-status-rerenders-session.md`](../gaps/public-share-status-rerenders-session.md).

  The remaining product gap is also independent of leak classification:
  active-window auto-trim stops after **Load older** and while the reader is
  away from the bottom. A history-expanded long-lived tab can therefore retain
  every loaded row indefinitely. The freeze/revive goal above must eventually
  bound far-away render state in that reading mode too, while preserving
  anchors and scroll position; the rejected `content-visibility` experiment is
  not sufficient.
- Conversation View condenses routine activity by default and can therefore
  reduce rendered rows, but it is not a history bound: a session or share that
  opens already active projects every currently loaded turn. Only an explicit
  off-to-on toggle starts at the latest configured user-turn window (100 by
  default) until the reader asks for earlier turns. Even that ephemeral window
  is not the freeze/revive solution because canonical messages and render-input
  state remain loaded.
- Long-session pages must not do whole-transcript React work on idle timers.
  Relative-age labels are useful UI, but historical rows should not receive a
  changing clock prop every tick. The only transcript row that needs a live
  stale-age clock by default is the latest visible timestamp row; older row
  age labels can stay at their mount-time relative age until some real session
  data changes.
- Compact-tail REST loading is part of the memory contract for Codex sessions:
  normal session-page loads should request a bounded recent tail such as the
  last two compaction windows. Full direct session REST payloads can be tens of
  megabytes and thousands of normalized renderable messages, so they are
  diagnostic/debug surfaces rather than the default browser transcript load.
- Compact-boundary tails are not by themselves a sufficient browser bound for
  Claude sessions with sparse compaction. Normal client session loads also send
  a conservative recent-turn cap, currently `tailTurns=20`. The turn cap
  narrows the default two-compaction scope; it never expands that scope unless
  `fullHistory=1` explicitly authorizes access across older compactions. This
  keeps both sparse-compaction Claude sessions and many-compaction Codex turns
  from rendering nearly the whole transcript by default.
- Initial loading applies `tailTurns=<n>` and
  `tailFrom=<message-id>` only to the initial non-incremental session detail
  response; streaming and `afterMessageId` refreshes append normally. The
  client store now auto-trims old prefixes while the reader follows the bottom,
  periodically restoring approximately the same semantic bounds as a fresh
  load. See
  [`docs/tactical/060-bounded-active-transcript-window.md`](../docs/tactical/060-bounded-active-transcript-window.md).
- CSS `content-visibility: auto` is not a safe default bound for transcript
  rows. A hosted mobile client confirmed repeated scroll-position corrections
  as variable-height rows replaced their intrinsic fallback sizes on first
  reveal. The browser-local experiment remains available but defaults off; see
  [`transcript-virtualization.md`](transcript-virtualization.md). A future bound
  should instead be explicit in the session-detail data model: keep the server
  transcript canonical, retain a contiguous recent semantic window on the
  client, and recover omitted history through pagination. That direction is now
  approved for implementation; the tactical contract is linked above.
- The old in-tab session-load cache was a developer convenience only:
  `VITE_SESSION_LOAD_CACHE=true` retained every visited transcript without
  production eviction or source/query invalidation. It proved the warm-return
  shape but was not the product path.
- Production session route retention uses explicit `SessionRouteSnapshot`
  entries instead: source-scoped, route/tail-window keyed, five-minute TTL,
  three-entry default cap, 24 MiB total byte cap, least-recently-used eviction,
  retained delta cursor, and retained scroll anchor. It is meant to work in
  development, production builds, and hosted/relay clients.
- Growth attribution is sampled, not reconstructed: when client log
  collection is active, `[ClientTelemetry]` entries (15 s cadence) carry JS
  heap size, DOM/row counts, and the session-detail store's deduped
  live-retained vs warm-cache byte aggregates
  (`getSessionTranscriptMemoryStats`, also shown in Performance settings).
  A multi-day tab that balloons should be explained from those samples
  before anyone reaches for a live heap snapshot.
- The bounded active-window feature does not add a per-trim log or telemetry
  event. Existing 15-second client samples already show the outcome through
  DOM message-row counts and deduped live/warm transcript bytes; store coverage
  proves an accepted trim reduces both its message count and approximate byte
  charge. This avoids duplicative console/log traffic and records no message
  content.
- Any future client-side transcript cache beyond `SessionRouteSnapshot` needs
  an explicit design note before it ships: what user-visible behavior it
  changes, what data it retains, its eviction policy, memory/entry limits,
  low-memory mobile behavior, invalidation and staleness rules, and why those
  trade-offs are acceptable. Ad hoc transcript caching must not be enabled by
  default.

## 2026-07-10: bounded active transcript window decision

The active mounted session should not retain every message received since the
page opened. Implement a client-local prefix trim that makes the retained
window approximate a fresh default page load without forcing provider
compaction or re-fetching the tail from the server.

Contract:

- Auto-trim is browser-local, default-on, and disableable in Performance
  settings. An explicitly stored disabled preference remains authoritative.
- Trim only while the reader is following the bottom. The operation should be
  silent and preserve bottom-follow across the atomic store update.
- Keep the last two compact windows and approximately the default recent-turn
  tail. Turn trimming uses hysteresis rather than trimming after every new turn;
  the initial target is 20 turns with a 30-turn trigger.
- The proposed retained-window start must be more than 60 seconds old. A
  missing or invalid boundary timestamp means do not trim. There is no timer:
  reconsider on later transcript growth.
- Loading older history suppresses auto-trim for the rest of that mounted
  session. Unmount resets the suppression; a later mount starts from the normal
  server-bounded tail again.
- The trim is an explicit session-detail reducer transition. It updates loaded-
  window pagination and prunes message-owned augments, tool/agent mappings, and
  completed agent content that is no longer reachable from retained rows.
- This policy intentionally does not impose a byte bound. It follows roughly
  the same semantic limits as reload; one unusually large retained turn may
  still be large.

The hot-path predicate must be cheap. Streaming tokens, placeholder updates,
metadata, augments, subagent updates, and scroll snapshots should exit through
constant-time gates without scanning the transcript. Only a new relevant user
turn/compact boundary, a persisted batch that can contain one, or a cached
age-delayed candidate becoming eligible should invoke the bounded planning
walk. Do not add a polling timer for this feature.

## 2026-07-09: real cause of the "10 GB tab" — un-virtualized transcript re-rendered every second

The `tailTurns=20` default (above) is a **mitigation, not the fix**. Measured
root cause of the browser-tab RSS growth:

- **It is not a JS/DOM leak.** On an idle session page, `usedJSHeapSize`, DOM
  node count, and JS listener count are flat over minutes. Heap-snapshot leak
  hunts correctly find nothing — the growth is native (Blink style/layout/paint
  objects, allocator high-water), which `usedJSHeapSize` does not count. That is
  why a tab reaches many GB while the V8 heap stays flat. Prior "there is no
  leak" conclusions were right *about the heap* and stopped one step short.
- **The transcript is not virtualized.** `MessageList` renders every message as
  a live DOM subtree (`MessageList.tsx`, `timelineEntryRows.map`). Native memory
  scales with total content (nodes, layout objects, raster), not viewport.
- **The whole transcript re-renders ~once per second, even when idle.** Measured
  headless (Playwright + CDP `Performance.getMetrics`/`Profiler`) against the
  live dev server, session `858312bb-…` idle (WebSocket messages = 0, rAF ≈ 0):

  | tail | rows | DOM nodes | JS heap | idle CPU-busy |
  |------|------|-----------|---------|---------------|
  | 20   | 244  | 12,985    | flat 65 MB  | 11% |
  | 400  | 1145 | 58,509    | flat 117 MB | 22% |

  Idle CPU scales with row count. The CPU profile shows `MessageAge` /
  `RenderItemComponent` / `jsxDEV` / React reconciliation hot, scheduled from
  microtask state flushes (not streaming). Two independent 5 s profiles (shorter
  than the 30 s clock) still show row rendering ⇒ rows re-render ~every second.
- **Trigger:** ~9 `setInterval(…, 1000)` timers on the session page (drafts,
  file-activity, reload-notify, liveness, …) re-render SessionPage every second.
  `MessageList` is `memo`-wrapped, but its memo is defeated by unstable
  inline-callback props from SessionPage — `getComposerDraft`
  (`SessionPage.tsx:4544`), `onCancelForkSummary` (`:4580`),
  `onToggleForkSummaryAutoOpen` (`:4583`) — so it re-executes and re-creates /
  reconciles all N row elements every second (the `jsxDEV` cost). Session-level
  clocks broadcast as per-row props (`staleNowMs`, `latestVisibleTimestampMs`,
  `isStreaming`) plus conditional inline arrows in the row map (`MessageList.tsx`
  ~2341/2348/2353) additionally break row-level `memo`.

So per-second O(N) style-recalc + layout + reconcile (recalcStyle counters climb
continuously on an idle page) churns native memory with a flat JS heap.
`tailTurns=20` only shrinks N; it does not stop the per-second O(N) churn or
bound the DOM. Streaming compounds it: each new message re-renders all N rows
while the transcript keeps growing.

Fix is staged — see [`transcript-virtualization.md`](transcript-virtualization.md):
(1) stabilize the memo-breaking props and decouple per-row clocks so an idle
transcript does ~zero work; (2) virtualize/window the transcript so DOM size and
per-tick work are bounded by viewport, not history.

Open item for the implementer: after (1), re-measure idle CPU with the probe in
that plan. If rows still re-render every second, a broadcast prop *value*
(`isStreaming`, or a liveness-derived value) is still changing each tick — trace
it before assuming (1) is complete.

### 2026-07-09 follow-up: the residual idle re-render was context, not clocks

Answering the open item above with direct measurement (temporary
`window.__mlRender` / `window.__riRender` render counters + CDP profile +
DOM-mutation observer, on the same full-transcript idle page):

- **`MessageList` re-renders ~0.1/s** on idle — item 1's `memo` holds. It is
  *not* re-rendering every second.
- **`RenderItemComponent` re-renders are a one-shot settling burst**, not steady
  churn: the same count over a 10 s and a 30 s idle window.
- The re-render that *did* persist was **context-driven**: `AgentContentContext`
  built a fresh `value` object every provider render. The provider re-renders on
  each SessionPage status-timer tick (~1/s), so the context value changed every
  second and re-rendered every subagent consumer (`TaskRenderer`,
  `SpawnAgentRenderer`, nested rows) — context propagation goes *through* `memo`,
  which is why item 1's prop stabilization did not stop it. The CPU-profile
  hotspots (`propagateParentContextChanges`, `formatAbsoluteTimestamp`,
  `jsxDEV`) drop after wrapping that value in `useMemo`.
- After the fix, the idle transcript DOM is essentially static (~1 mutation/s,
  only the processing indicator). No steady DOM growth, no leak — confirming the
  original "flat heap" reading was right; the cost was wasted render-phase work,
  now removed at its source.

Consequence for the plan: `transcript-virtualization.md` Stage 1 items 2–3
(row-map inline arrows; per-row clock decoupling) are **moot**, not merely
deferred — the churn they target does not occur once the context value is
memoized. The per-row clock was already gated in code
(`getRenderItemStaleNowMs` returns `undefined` for non-latest rows).

Measurement caveat: the shared dev server's load/highlight timing is noisy. A
fixed post-load settle sometimes catches load-time shiki re-highlight (bursts of
`fixed-font-rendered__content` / `shiki-container` child-list mutations that
*do* settle). Trust only quiescence-gated samples — poll the transcript
DOM-mutation rate and measure only once it falls below a small threshold.

## 2026-05-12: heartbeat session `019e1ac6-c836-7e33-891e-2ba878d27ca5`

- Confirmed metadata persisted for `019e1ac6-c836-7e33-891e-2ba878d27ca5` includes:
  - `heartbeatTurnsEnabled: true`
  - `heartbeatTurnsAfterMinutes: 30`
  - `heartbeatForceAfterMinutes: 5`
  - provider `codex`.
- `session-metadata.json` is authoritative at `~/.yep-anywhere/session-metadata.json`.

## Heartbeat pipeline checkpoints that could block delivery

- For owned processes, supervisor checks:
  - heartbeat enabled for session,
  - `process.isTerminated === false`,
  - `process.queueDepth === 0`,
  - `process.isProcessAlive === true`,
  - state/derived status is either `idle` + `verified-idle` OR `in-turn` +
    one of `verified-progressing`, `recently-active-unverified`,
    `long-silent-unverified`.
- For unowned candidates, it additionally requires `hasPendingToolCall === true`,
  candidate provider supports steering, and metadata flag enabled.
- No explicit heartbeat text is sent if any of the above are false.

## Current observed evidence

- Search across `~/.yep-anywhere` did not find any
  `heartbeat_turn_queued`/`heartbeat_turn_failed` entries containing the session.
- No session-specific heartbeat trace exists in local persisted JSONL logs.
- `recents.json` shows this session was visited at `2026-05-12T14:56:52.826Z`.
- Index metadata (`~/.yep-anywhere/indexes/...json`) shows it is the most
  recently updated `tend` session and near context/window limits (~93% usage),
  but this does not itself indicate heartbeat state.

## Likely next checks

- At runtime, inspect the live process object for this session:
  `getProcessForSession(sessionId)` state fields (`isProcessAlive`, `queueDepth`,
  derived liveness) at heartbeat tick.
- Confirm heartbeat scheduler is actually running and logger sink captures
  `heartbeat_turn_*` events in the server runtime you are attached to.
