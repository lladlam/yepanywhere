- OpenCode backend capability and rendering parity
- OpenCode ses_ session ID unification with YA session ID
- MessageQueue batch delivery and steering UI
- Message-control and queue intent (`/btw`, queue intent, later-interrupt state contract)
- Queue survival across compaction boundaries (verified-idle/patient queue lost on Claude compaction termination)
- Queued messages: server-authoritative design (draft-only localStorage, no fuzzy matching)
- Emulated slash commands
- Provider-agnostic /btw asides
- Side session configuration
- OpenAI-compatible helper sessions
- Prompt suggestions
- Session liveness and queue intent
- Provider process state machine
- Compact-and-handoff guardrail (targeted provider/model policy)
- Claude 1M vs 200K context window (resolution, reporting, autocompact)
- Exposing older Claude models (Opus 4.7/4.6/4.5, Sonnet 4.5) as an opt-in path
- Heartbeat ownership and timers
- Claude provider control
- Codex API provider as a future API-key-backed backend
- Pixel-scale icon aesthetics
- UI testing and screenshot regression checks
- Mobile transcript horizontal overflow (outer session scrollbar above
  composer when wide Grep/tool content leaks past local scrollers)
- Provider/model compact glyph vocabulary (top-right status)
- Claude API failures and auto-retry (transient 5xx/overload evidence)
- Media rendering and routing (image/video/file surfaces, the relay fetch rule, serving doors)
- Sidebar session ordering (active rows pinned and stable, idle rows deduped by recency)
- Session list hidden duplicates (conservative duplicate-title hiding, fork/helper lineage, current/source session safety)
- Deferred & tactical roadmap (prioritized: backgrounded-jobs badge, `Task*` list rendering, queue-across-compaction, rich-text gaps, OpenCode/pi provider fleshout)
- pi provider (Zechner's pi-mono as agnostic backend: integration plan + periodic progress tracking)
- Provider read/edit disciplines (native edit formats vs YA's one canonical Read/Edit/Write presentation)
- Collapse/expand mode (brainstorm: default-collapse more actions; expand subagent progress as pure outline UI)
- Conversation view (opt-in condensed transcript preserving agent text,
  images, and failures with one expandable elapsed/activity summary per turn)
- Session hover card recent activity (add last regular agent turn excerpt to the row tooltip; fire it on all-sessions + search too)
- Tooltip interactions (native fallback, themed pointer-rest delay, warm adjacent scanning, and future rendered hidden tails)
- Turn-notch actions / fork-from-turn (fork already exists; proposal: expose fork/copy/trim from scrollbar notches + seed compose with the forked turn)
- Turn-rail marker layout (hit targets sized to neighbor gaps; optional PAVA de-cluster spread behind one off-by-default constant)
- Client global store (coarse normalized sessions/projects/project queues/inbox summary cache, not transcript state)
- Session summary fidelity (bounded list projections, complete-index isolation,
  and partial-observation nondowngrade rules)
- Client source runtime topology (per-YA-server runtime boundary above summary/query/session-detail stores)
- Session media handles (problem statement for lazy transcript image/blob
  payloads behind authenticated server media IDs)
- Session exit navigation latency (large transcript should not delay first
  paint of Settings/other lightweight routes)
- Workstreams (lane-aware Project Queue; each lane is a real checkout of the
  repository syncing through the shared upstream)
- Module boundary refactor discipline (move-only slices, naming and
  coordination rules, tripwire matrix, and verification tiers for the
  large-file extraction campaign)
- Portable transcript compiler (stable server ingest, bounded window + prefix
  facts, and shared semantic projection for web/Android/iOS native renderers)
- Agents multi-session activity preview (default-off condensed live activity
  for active processes and last-output previews for recently idle ones)
- Agents process observability (default-off host metrics plus read-only
  discovery of externally launched local provider processes)
- Bang commands (`!!` composer messages run local shell commands as
  persistent inline display objects, never entering provider context; tab
  completion, rendered output, cross-session history)
- Interactives (proposal: zero-setup container for agent-built project web
  apps — opinionated template, committed files, registry, icon links,
  YA-server-only reach via relay with optional globally configured Tailscale
  and Cloudflare paths, meta-UI comment channel)
- Rich interviews (banked: multi-round structured-input flows rendered inline
  from declared formats; revisit atop interactives machinery)
- Server plugin arch (banked no: settings-gated loadable server code;
  monolith convenience wins absent a contributing community)
- Project settings overrides (banked seed: project-scoped overrides beating
  global settings; mechanically easy, visualization is the cost)
