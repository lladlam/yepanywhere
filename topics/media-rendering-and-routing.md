## The connection rule (why media is different)

The client reaches the server two ways:

- **Direct** (`DirectConnection`) — localhost/LAN/Tailscale. The page origin
  *is* the YA server, so a plain `fetch("/api/...")` or `<img src="/api/...">`
  reaches it.
- **Relay** (`RelayProtocol` / `SecureConnection`) — the page is loaded from the
  hosted relay client (e.g. a static site), and the real server is on the far
  end of a WebSocket tunnel. **The page origin has no `/api` backend.** A native
  browser request to `/api/...` (an `<img src>`, an anchor navigation, a raw
  `fetch`) hits the static origin and 404s.

So in relay mode bytes can only arrive through `connection.fetchBlob(path)` over
the tunnel. The shared pattern across every surface is therefore: **fetch the
bytes as a `Blob` through the connection, wrap in `URL.createObjectURL`, render
that object URL.** Helpers that encapsulate this:

- `fetchMediaBlob` / `fetchLocalResourceBlob` (`components/LocalMediaModal.tsx`) —
  `connection.fetchBlob` when remote, credentialed `fetch` when direct.
- `useFetchedImage` / `useRemoteImage` (`hooks/useRemoteImage.ts`) — the hook
  form, returns an object URL.
- `RelayProtocol.fetchBlob` normalizes the `/api` prefix, so callers can pass
  either `/api/...` or `/...`.

The recurring bug is any surface that skips this and emits a bare API URL: it
works on the developer's own machine (direct mode) and 404s for everyone on a
phone through the relay. The base64 `data:` surfaces are immune (no network).

## Where media appears in the UI

Each surface below is named by *what the user is looking at*, then the component
and the route it pulls from.

### Inline in the transcript

- **Image-bearing tool result** — `Read`, `ViewImage`, and provider-neutral
  image-bearing results converge on the shared outline media row. Its `+ / -`
  toggle controls a lazy object-URL preview. Route:
  `/api/projects/:id/sessions/:sid/media/:mediaId`. Relay-safe. Legacy
  unmaterialized `Read` results retain their base64 renderer as a compatibility
  fallback.
- **Embedded media inside rendered Markdown/HTML** — an `![](...)` image or
  video that appears inline within an assistant/user message body.
  `useLocalMediaInlinePreviews` (`components/LocalMediaModal.tsx`) hydrates the
  `local-media-inline-preview` placeholders emitted by the server Markdown
  augment; it's wired from `blocks/TextBlock.tsx` and
  `renderers/blocks/TextRenderer.tsx`. Route: `/api/local-image`. Relay-safe.
- **Legacy path-backed ViewImage result** — a historical result without a
  media handle still opens its path through `LocalMediaModal` and
  `/api/local-image`. New live and durable results snapshot permitted paths
  into the session media store before rendering.

### Modals opened by clicking a link

- **File viewer modal (tool-result filename links)** — click a filename in a
  `Read`/`Edit`/`Grep`/`Write` row and a modal opens showing the file: code with
  highlighting, a Markdown preview, or — for images — the picture in the modal
  body. `SessionFilePathLink` → `FilePathLink` → `FileViewer` (in
  `FileViewerModal`). Routes: `/api/projects/:id/files` (metadata) and
  `/files/raw` (bytes). Relay-safe **as of the `fetchRawFileBlob` fix**; before
  that the image `<img src>` used the raw URL directly and 404'd in relay mode.
- **Local media modal (rendered-text media links)** — click an image/video link
  *inside* rendered Markdown/HTML and a modal shows it. `useLocalResourceClick`
  → `LocalMediaModal` → `/api/local-image`. Relay-safe.
- **Local file modal (rendered-text file links)** — click a non-media local file
  link in rendered text; a modal renders text/JSON/log inline, PDFs from a blob
  URL, and (direct mode) HTML/Markdown in a sandboxed iframe. `LocalFileModal`
  → `/api/local-file`. Relay-safe.

### Composer and new-session

- **Attachment chips** — image thumbnails on a sent user message and in the
  composer's pending-attachment row. `components/AttachmentChip.tsx` via
  `useRemoteImage` → `/api/projects/:id/sessions/:sid/upload/:filename`.
  Rendered from `MessageInput.tsx`, `MessageList.tsx`, and
  `blocks/UserPromptBlock.tsx`. Relay-safe.
- **New-session pending file preview** — a thumbnail in the new-session form for
  a file you've attached but not yet uploaded. `NewSessionForm.tsx`, using a
  local `File` object URL (pre-upload). No network, always works.

### Read-only shares

- **Public-share file viewer** — on a shared session page, clicking a file opens
  the same `FileViewer`, but backed by a share-scoped source
  (`publicShareFileViewerSource.ts`) that fetches `/public-api/shares/:secret/
  files/raw` through the relay+secret path. Relay-safe.

## Proposed refinement: anchored attachment hover preview

Current state: image attachment chips already show a full-image hover preview
after a brief linger (`AttachmentChip.tsx`, `HOVER_PREVIEW_LINGER_MS = 450`),
but the preview is a centered, viewport-fixed overlay. It does not choose a
direction from the thumbnail or avoid covering nearby context except by hiding
when the click modal opens.

Desired behavior for all image attachment thumbnails (composer, sent user
turns, and parsed user-prompt blocks):

- Keep the short hover delay so incidental cursor travel does not flash an
  image.
- Anchor the enlarged preview to the hovered thumbnail, not the center of the
  viewport.
- Choose the side with the most available space (prefer below/above when they
  can show the image at useful size; otherwise left/right), and flip when the
  first choice cannot fit.
- Resize the preview to fit inside the viewport with a small margin while
  preserving aspect ratio; never create page scrollbars or crop the image.
- Fetch/display bytes through the existing attachment preview path
  (`useCachedAttachmentImage` / `useRemoteImage`) so relay mode and cached
  thumbnail/full-image behavior stay unchanged.
- Leave touch behavior on the explicit click modal; hover-only enlargement is a
  desktop affordance.

## Proposed refinement: compact turn image galleries

When **Expand Inline Media by Default** is enabled, several tall images in one
assistant turn can consume the visible transcript and push the turn's
informative text above the viewport. A completed final response can then look
like an interrupted response on return: the visible tail is mostly screenshots,
while the actual completion text is offscreen.

The compact presentation is owned by the whole assistant turn, not by the
position of an image link within its text. Images anywhere in that turn are
eligible. It applies only to previews that YA expanded automatically; an image
the user explicitly expands remains full-size and outside the compact gallery.
One image may retain the existing inline presentation. Multiple images use a
gallery when their ordinary vertical stack would exceed the turn's media
budget.

The compact-gallery goals, in priority order, are:

- Where the turn is short enough, keep all of its informative text and the
  gallery visible together. Long turns make that impossible, so this is a
  target rather than a guarantee.
- Give the gallery at most roughly one third of the transcript viewport while
  a useful compact preview is possible. It may use less height when that lets
  the turn text fit.
- Keep relative reduction reasonably even: one screenshot should not become
  illegible merely so another can remain close to its normal inline size.
- Use the available vertical budget without treating complete content-width
  fill as a goal. Rows may have different heights.
- Present ordinary completed rows as justified image rows. The final or
  pathologically sparse row may remain ragged; dead horizontal space is
  acceptable rather than enlarging images solely to consume it. Roughly 100
  pixels of leftover row width is an initial tuning signal, not a persistent
  format constant.
- Preserve each image's stable filename/identity and full-size target, but do
  not preserve image occurrence order as a presentation constraint. The
  gallery may reorder a turn's automatically presented images to improve
  legibility and packing. Filename references in the prose remain in their
  original transcript order.

A deterministic greedy row fill with one-image lookahead is a plausible first
layout strategy. Small bounded exact searches are also acceptable, but the
observable contract is balanced, stable packing rather than a globally optimal
permutation. The same image dimensions and available space should produce the
same arrangement, and small resize changes should not cause gratuitous
reshuffling.

The gallery has one turn-level **Dismiss gallery** action, with a keyboard
accelerator. Dismissing removes the reordered gallery and reinstates each image
as the existing minimal filename link at that image reference's original
inline position. The transcript's original text/image-reference order is
therefore always recoverable even though gallery packing may reorder
thumbnails. Re-expanding those compact links restores the same deterministic
gallery arrangement; there is no second “dismiss to expanded inline images”
state. Selecting a thumbnail opens a full-screen image viewer; full-size
inspection is separate from persistent full inline expansion.

### Phone presentation and deferred gesture

On phone, a single horizontally swipeable thumbnail row is a reasonable compact
presentation. It spends horizontal overflow instead of shrinking several
screenshots into nearly unreadable fixed columns. A partially visible next
thumbnail can disclose the swipe affordance. Selecting an image opens a
scrollable, pinch-zoomable full-screen view, and returning preserves the
transcript position.

A post-v1 interaction experiment may combine selection and enlargement in one
two-axis gesture: horizontal finger movement scrubs through the row, while
moving the same drag upward toward the top of the screen enlarges the currently
centered image. This is not required for the first gallery implementation. It
needs touch testing for accidental activation and conflict with ordinary
vertical transcript scrolling, plus a complete tap/full-screen path for users
who do not discover or cannot perform the gesture.

## Which route serves the file (the "doors")

There are two routing systems and several serving routes. The serving route
determines the **permission model**, not just the URL.

Serving routes:

| Route | Access model | Source file |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| `/api/local-image` | File-access allow-set (see below) | `routes/local-image.ts` |
| `/api/local-file` | Same allow-set (text/PDF/HTML/Markdown) | `routes/local-file.ts` |
| `/api/projects/:id/files` + `/files/raw` | Relative paths project-scoped; **absolute/`~` paths gated by the same file-access allow-set** | `routes/files.ts` |
| `/api/projects/:id/sessions/:sid/upload/:filename` | Files uploaded to that session | `routes/upload.ts` |
| `/api/projects/:id/sessions/:sid/media/:mediaId` | Authenticated session-scoped opaque tool-result handle | `routes/tool-result-media.ts` |
| `/public-api/shares/:secret/files/raw` | Share-scoped, capability-gated by secret | `routes/public-shares.ts` |

**The file-access allow-set** is one effective list enforced by **both** doors
(media routes and the project-files route), shared via
`routes/local-resource-policy.ts` (drive-letter/symlink-safe). It is the union
of user-toggled sources — projects ∪ uploads ∪ temp ∪ home ∪ custom — held live
in `middleware/file-access.ts` and editable in Settings → Local Access → File
access. `ALLOWED_FILE_PATHS` (alias `ALLOWED_IMAGE_PATHS`) pins it from the
environment. Secure by default: out-of-project absolute paths are denied unless
their folder is in the set. See `docs/tactical/018-file-access-scoping.md`.

Two client routing systems decide *which* surface a link opens:

- **Tool-result filename links** — `SessionFilePathLink` → `FilePathLink`. These
  always open the `FileViewer` against `/api/projects/:id/files`, regardless of
  whether the path is inside the project or an outside safe-dir path like
  `C:\tmp\...`. `getProjectViewerFilePath` only affects the *displayed* path, not
  the route.
- **Rendered-text links** — `useLocalResourceClick` parses each link into a
  `LocalResourceRef` (`local-media` | `local-file` | `project-raw-file`) using
  the shared `parseLocalResourceLink` (`packages/shared/src/local-resource.ts`).
  `normalizeResourceForProjectContext` sends *in-project* paths to the project
  `FileViewer`, and everything else to the `LocalMediaModal` / `LocalFileModal`
  (the allow-listed `/api/local-image` / `/api/local-file` doors).

The two routing systems still pick *different surfaces* for the same path, but
that no longer changes the **permission** outcome: both surfaces now resolve
against the same file-access allow-set. So a `C:\tmp` image that takes the
project-files route enforces the same allow-set as the media door would — the
historical "safe-dir image opened through the project files route" 404 is gone.

## Known sharp edges

- **Bare API URLs in relay mode** — the canonical failure. Fixed in the
  `FileViewer` by giving the default source a `fetchRawFileBlob`; watch for it
  in any new surface.
- **In-project vs. out-of-project routing** — tool-result links always use the
  project files route; rendered-text links split by location. The two systems
  don't share the in/out-of-project decision.
- **Both doors share one allow-set** — as of `docs/tactical/018`, the
  project-files route enforces the same file-access allow-set as the media
  doors for absolute/`~` paths (relative paths stay project-scoped). The set is
  secure-by-default, so absolute paths outside projects/uploads/temp are denied
  until the user adds the folder (Settings → File access) or sets
  `ALLOWED_FILE_PATHS`.
- **Context-specific media remains** — normalized tool-result images share one
  media row, and modal-based local images share `LocalMediaModal`; attachments,
  rendered Markdown placeholders, and the project `FileViewer` retain
  context-specific presentation. Cross-surface fixes still belong in a shared
  source adapter or the narrowest common rendering boundary.
