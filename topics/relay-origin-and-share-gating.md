## Public Share Authorization

Public shares are bearer-link read-only views. The server generates at least a
512-bit URL secret, stores only a hash of that secret, and exposes no public
lookup route by project id, session id, or sequential share id. This blocks
guessing from no link.

Anyone who possesses the full public share URL can fetch the share until it is
revoked or, for live shares, until the owner stops live access. That includes a
party who observes the public share secret in transit through an authorized
public-share transport.

Public shares do not intentionally provide a path to spend the YA server's
metered STT credits. Public-share relay plaintext is restricted to `GET
/public-api/shares/...`; it must not tunnel `/api/speech/*`, relayed speech
channels, server-mediated STT, server-minted xAI client secrets, or borrowed
long-lived xAI keys.

## Relay Operator Visibility

Normal authenticated Remote Access uses SRP plus NaCl end-to-end encryption.
For that mode, the relay should see connection metadata such as username,
timing, and sizes, but not decrypted application contents.

Public shares are currently a deliberate exception. The hosted public viewer
opens a relay WebSocket and sends unauthenticated, share-secret-bearing
`GET /public-api/shares/:secret...` requests as plaintext relay payloads. WSS
protects the browser-to-relay hop from ordinary network observers, and the
current relay implementation forwards frames rather than logging share payloads,
but a relay operator who inspects or modifies the relay can see the public share
request path, bearer secret, and response contents.

Therefore public shares are secret-link protected against guessing and against
viewers who do not possess the link, but they are not currently private from the
relay operator. User-facing security claims must not describe public shares as
relay-operator-private until a public-share E2E design lands.

## Public File Views

Public-share file views may use a dedicated unauthenticated top-level route so
the read-only trust boundary remains explicit. Inside that boundary, shared UI
code should still carry the normal file-viewer shell, spacing, rendered
Markdown behavior, local-media modal, copy affordances, and line/source toggle
behavior where those affordances are read-only.

The same architecture rule applies to the public session viewport: an
independent unauthenticated shell can be safer, but transcript rows, rendered
item flow, inspection affordances, copy interactions, spacing, and other
read-only UI behavior should stay shared with the normal session surface where
the trust boundary permits it.

Public session shares start in the shared Conversation View projection and
offer a compact floating icon to restore the full activity transcript. This
viewer state is ephemeral and independent of the owner's toolbar visibility
and last local Conversation View choice. Live viewers also use the shared
session near-bottom follow machinery: new output follows while they remain at
the live edge, and scrolling away exposes **Follow** beside the floating
Conversation control. Frozen shares have no Follow action because their
transcript cannot advance. See [conversation-view.md](conversation-view.md).

Share-scoped file requests are allowed only for files visible from shared
session content and for bounded transitive render assets from visible
Markdown/HTML sources. Frozen snapshot shares should eventually capture an
immutable manifest of linked files and render assets; live shares may refresh
that manifest only from deliberate share-visible content.

Broadcast share links do not gain access merely because authenticated assistant
Markdown rendered an inline-code project filename as a file-viewer link. Those
private project-file anchors are omitted or stripped in public-share views, so
the public transcript shows the filename as text/code rather than a clickable
file-viewer route. A future explicit share mode may expose all linked project
files, but that is a new capability and must be modeled as such rather than
falling out of ordinary broadcast-share rendering.

## Future E2E Direction

A relay-operator-private public share design needs encryption before relay
payloads are produced. Plausible shapes include a fragment-held public-share
decryption key, encrypted request/response envelopes for the public share API,
opaque manifest asset ids instead of raw paths, and snapshot assets encrypted at
capture time. The browser fragment can keep secrets out of HTTP requests, but
the design still has to account for hosted JavaScript integrity and revocation.

## Source Control Is Not Shareable

The source-control surface (git browse, blame, diffs, review comments,
review submit) is security-sensitive to the same degree as issuing
commands in a session: it reads arbitrary repository content and its
submit path launches or steers agent sessions. It is never available
through read-only share links, live or not. Structurally, public
shares live in the secret-token `/public-api/shares` namespace while
every source-control route mounts under authenticated `/api/projects/*`
— keep that separation; a future share mode that wants any source view
must be modeled as a new explicit capability, not reached by widening
share rendering.
