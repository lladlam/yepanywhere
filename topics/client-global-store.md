# Client Global Store

> YA's client global store is a coarse, normalized cache of server-visible
> summary state. It is the place UI surfaces read shared facts about sessions,

## Purpose

YA has several UI surfaces that render overlapping summaries of the same
underlying work:

- Sidebar;
- All Sessions;
- Inbox;
- Projects;
- New Session project chooser;
- Session Page composer affordances;
- Agents/process views.

When each surface fetches and caches its own row arrays, small feature work tends
to create inconsistencies: a badge appears in one place, a liveness hint appears
in another, and a stale response can undo a newer activity event. The global
store should be the center of gravity for shared summary facts so UI features
compose from the same records and projections.

The code uses the `clientSummary` name for this widened store shell. "Summary"
is intentional: it is a shared cache for coarse server-visible facts, not a home
for full session message data or provider transcript payloads.

In hosted remote mode, each connected backend host has its own summary cache.
Default hooks read from the current host's cache; future multi-host views must
use explicit cross-source selectors instead of making ordinary session surfaces
aggregate by accident.

## Boundary

The store owns coarse summary state:

- session summaries and query membership;
- project summaries and project list membership;
- project queue summaries;
- inbox tier membership;
- shared settings snapshots, once migrated;
- local lightweight decorations such as draft badges;
- observation timestamps for stale snapshot protection.

The store does not own heavy or page-local state:

- full messages;
- provider JSONL;
- streaming transcript deltas;
- rendered transcript bodies;
- composer text;
- upload progress internals;
- per-page filters, selection, expansion, and scroll state.

The Session Page can keep detailed live transcript state local while reporting
summary updates into the store. In particular, the complete composer string
stays in `MessageInput`/draft persistence. A stable session-scoped signal may
publish draft edits to narrow page-local consumers such as quote
reconciliation, and queued action leaves may subscribe to a primitive
composer-availability snapshot; neither belongs in the summary store.

Reactive primitive browser preferences also stay outside the summary store.
Their shared `localStorage` external-store interface lazily initializes an
in-memory snapshot, updates it through application setters, and reconciles
cross-tab storage events. A migration, settings import, or test that writes
storage directly must explicitly invalidate the affected key or all preference
snapshots. Unrelated React renders and direct same-tab DevTools writes do not
implicitly reread storage.

## Source Model

The store is per backend source. A source is the YA server that produced the
facts, such as:

- `local`;
- `host:<SavedHost.id>` for saved relay/direct remote hosts;
- `direct:<normalized-ws-url>` for unsaved direct remote fallbacks;
- `remote:none` while a hosted client is unauthenticated or switching hosts.

`ClientSummaryState` remains normalized per source. The registry above it maps
source keys to Zustand store instances. Current UI hooks select from the current
source only.

The store is fed by multiple inputs:

- REST snapshots from sessions, projects, inbox, and project queue APIs;
- settings API snapshots and successful settings mutations, once migrated;
- activity-bus events;
- successful local actions such as star/archive/rename and queue mutations;
- local browser facts such as draft presence, where appropriate.

REST snapshots are authoritative for what they queried, but they are not allowed
to overwrite newer field groups observed from events or local successful
actions within the same source. Missed activity events are healed by later REST
snapshots for that source.

Collection snapshots and activity events may contain only a subset of one
session's facts. Omitted fields preserve richer values already in the
normalized record; producers must not send compatibility placeholders for
facts they did not observe. The cross-layer fidelity and nondowngrade rules
live in [`session-summary-fidelity.md`](session-summary-fidelity.md).

The activity bus remains the fast event transport. The global store does not
replace it and does not make events durable. Activity events that reduce into
summary state must carry or capture their backend source so a host switch cannot
apply an old host event to the new host's cache.

## Fetch Model

Feed hooks own fetch mechanics:

- remote connection readiness;
- current summary source key capture;
- pagination;
- loading and error state;
- request start timestamps;
- reporting snapshots into the store.

Store selectors own UI data:

```ts
const feed = useGlobalSessionsFeed(options);
const rows = useSessionQueryRecords(feed.query);
```

The UI should not render authoritative session/project row arrays returned
directly from data hooks. Feed hooks may expose query descriptors and controls;
selectors return the shared records/projections.

Feed hooks that publish snapshots capture the current source key when starting a
request and pass that key to report functions. A late response from
`host:macbook` updates the MacBook cache, even if the visible current source has
since changed to `host:winnative`.

## Shape

Each per-source store should remain normalized:

```ts
{
  sessions: {
    entities: Map<sessionId, SessionRecord>,
    queries: Map<queryKey, SessionQueryState>
  },
  projects: {
    entities: Map<projectId, ProjectRecord>,
    queries: Map<queryKey, ProjectQueryState>
  },
  projectQueues: {
    byProject: Map<projectId, ProjectQueueSummaryState>
  },
  inbox: {
    tiers: Record<InboxTier, sessionId[]>
  }
}
```

The source registry wraps this shape:

```ts
Map<ClientSummarySourceKey, StoreApi<ClientSummaryState>>
```

Do not copy project facts onto every session. Compose them at selector time.
For example, a session card can read its session record, its project record, the
project queue summary, and local draft state to produce badges.

## Performance Contract

The registry may be global internally, but components should subscribe narrowly
to the current source's store.

Selectors should return stable values whenever the selected data did not change.
Hot row surfaces should not subscribe to the whole store. Updates should replace
only changed records and changed query membership arrays.

Changing the current source key must cause current-source hooks to resubscribe
to the new source's store. They must not keep rendering records from the
previous host while the new host is connecting or loading.

When new slices are added, add tests for:

- unchanged entity object identity after unrelated updates;
- unchanged query array identity when membership and record refs are stable;
- row render isolation for common list surfaces.

## Current Direction

The first widened-store step migrated the existing session collection substrate
to Zustand, then renamed the aggregate shell to `clientSummaryState` /
`clientSummaryStore` once project and queue slices made the older name too
narrow. The next slice added project summary records and project-list membership
to the same store, with `useProjects` and `useProject` feeding snapshots while
keeping request lifecycle local.

The next slice added project queue summaries. `useProjectQueues` remains the
feed/mutation hook, but queue snapshots, mutation responses, and
`project-queue-changed` events now reduce into the shared store. Sidebar keeps a
queue feed mounted for visible projects and reads `Q` badges from a store-owned
targeted-session selector.

All Sessions and Inbox now use the same Project Queue decoration path for
visible session cards. Session draft badges also read from client-summary local
decorations: the store wrapper owns the mounted `draft-message-*` localStorage
initial scan, cross-tab storage listener, and owned same-tab presence-event
subscription. It tears down both listeners when the last draft-decoration
consumer unmounts; no draft-decoration polling timer remains. Draft discovery
uses one private presence marker per `(source, session)` rather than a shared
read/modify/write set, so simultaneous tabs cannot overwrite one another's
index additions. Every successful envelope write reconciles its marker, even
when text remains nonempty, so a failed first marker write is repaired by the
next edit. Scans verify markers against their envelopes, prune stale markers,
and migrate the retired aggregate index when encountered.

The original session collection fields are now nested under `sessions`, matching
the documented normalized shape.

Inbox tier membership now lives in the summary store as ordered session ids.
`InboxContext` remains the feed/lifecycle boundary for remote readiness,
loading/error, stable tier ordering, debounced refetch, and refresh controls,
but accepted `/api/inbox` snapshots report partial session facts plus tier ids
into the store. Existing consumers still read through `useInboxContext`, whose
arrays are selected from the shared store.

The next likely work is tracked in
[`027-client-summary-source-registry.md`](../docs/tactical/027-client-summary-source-registry.md):
move the singleton Zustand store to a per-backend-source registry so hosted
remote host switches cannot leak Sidebar, Inbox, Project, or queue summary data
between machines. After that source boundary is in place,
[`026-client-summary-long-tail.md`](../docs/tactical/026-client-summary-long-tail.md)
continues the selector narrowing and hook retirement work.
