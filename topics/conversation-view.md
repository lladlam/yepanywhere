## Motivation

YA's full transcript is valuable while an agent works, but reads, searches,
edits, commands, and tool results can make it hard to scan back to the actual
exchange—especially on a phone where scrollbar bookmarks are not practical.
The compact view must still show that work happened and allow one-step recovery
of the exact rows. It is a different view of the same loaded transcript, not a
provider-history rewrite and not deletion.

## Observable contract

- The feature and its two-bubble Session Toolbar control are **on by default**.
  The control uses the `last` narrowing tier and switches between the condensed
  conversation and full activity transcript. This is a deliberate
  [Vanilla Defaults](vanilla-defaults.md) exception approved as matching the
  normal condensed presentation of the Codex and Claude harnesses.
- The mode is browser/device-local, persists across sessions and tabs, and is
  included in browser-settings backup. The toolbar-presence choice for this
  control is also client-only: it is not sent as a
  `clientDefaults.sessionToolbarPresence` key to servers that may not recognize
  it. The last owner toggle on this browser profile is the default for newly
  opened sessions and tabs on that device; there is no duplicate default-state
  setting or cross-device last-writer synchronization. Existing stored mode and
  presence choices remain authoritative. Explicitly changing the toolbar
  control from hidden to shown activates Conversation view; merely changing a
  shown control's narrowing tier does not overwrite the current mode.
- A session or share that opens with Conversation view already active condenses
  the entire currently loaded transcript; default-on does not itself truncate
  history. Explicitly switching Conversation view from off to on in a mounted
  view starts at the latest 100 user turns. **Toolbar → Conversation View
  history** configures this browser-local activation limit from 10 to 500 turns
  in steps of 10 and includes it in browser-settings backup. The boundary is a
  user prompt: its corresponding assistant response and all following
  standalone display objects remain in order.
- When older loaded turns exist above that boundary, the ordinary top history
  affordance reports the visible turn count and reveals up to another configured
  window. If the canonical session also has unloaded history, the same action
  may request the next older page as the local boundary approaches it. Revealed
  history is ephemeral to the mounted view: it does not change the configured
  default, delete transcript data, or persist a provider/session mutation.
- Conversation view retains user prompts, session setup, transcript display
  objects, agent-authored text, ordinary system notices, warnings, and errors.
  Tool calls with media remain visible, using their existing media renderer, so
  images stay associated with the agent turn's text.
- Routine tool calls (pending, complete, or aborted), Thinking rows,
  non-failing task notifications, and subagent-activity notices condense.
  Tool errors, incomplete calls, and task notifications whose structured
  status is `failed` or `error` retain their ordinary rows because their
  summary or output path may be the only human-readable failure detail.
  Notifications without a structured failure status remain routine activity;
  YA does not infer failure from unconstrained summary prose.
- Each assistant turn with condensed activity ends in one summary button. A
  completed summary reads like `4m elapsed · 17 activities hidden`; the live
  edge reads like `Working 4m · 17 activities`. If source timestamps are
  unavailable, the label keeps the activity count without inventing a time.
- Clicking the summary restores every condensed row in its original transcript
  position. The summary remains at the turn end as the one-click collapse
  control. Manual expansion remains sticky while that session view stays
  mounted.
- Switching the whole mode or expanding one turn preserves bottom-follow when
  already at the live edge; otherwise it restores the visible render-row anchor
  (with height-delta fallback) so the reader does not jump to an unrelated
  passage.
- Search follows the currently projected transcript. Condensed tool/thinking
  text does not produce hidden matches; expanding its turn makes those rows
  searchable again.
- The thinking-transcript visibility control composes with Conversation View
  instead of being shadowed by it. When thinking is visible, a compact preview
  follows the final activity summary on the same wrapping row: the latest block
  (current while streaming) and at most one preceding completed block. A block
  restored by expanding its ordinary activity summary is not duplicated in the
  preview. Preview text participates in the projected search scope. The row
  packs the activity summary and both previews together whenever their measured
  target widths fit, then wraps whole cards when they do not.
- Each thinking-preview slot can be collapsed or dismissed independently.
  Streaming updates to the block occupying a slot do not reopen a collapsed
  card. Dismissing the final visible card switches the thinking-transcript
  control off; switching that control on again restores both available cards
  expanded. A lone remaining card may use the width released by its dismissed
  peer.
- While at least one thinking preview is expanded, the activity column may show
  the three newest concrete activity kinds below its count. File operations may
  add a basename and commands may add a bounded description or verb-first
  command fragment. These previews remain whole single lines, may truncate, and
  cannot widen the activity column; the complete ordinary tool summary remains
  available as a tooltip. Collapsing every thinking card removes the activity
  names without reserving vertical space.
- A thinking card begins at a compact target width. Its target may grow as the
  same thinking block streams but never shrinks until that slot receives a new
  block; the card may then reset to a narrower measured target. Targets remain
  clamped by the card and row bounds. This per-block hysteresis avoids
  paragraph-by-paragraph layout oscillation without retaining a cross-turn
  moving average.
- Standalone bold lines that the thinking renderer recognizes as Codex outline
  headings use a smaller, lighter subhead treatment than ordinary Markdown
  headings. The treatment belongs to the shared thinking renderer, so it is
  identical in transcript expansion and Conversation previews without
  rewriting the source Markdown.
- Public session shares are the explicit default-state exception. Their
  independent read-only shell starts in Conversation view and exposes a compact
  floating icon toggle regardless of the owner's toolbar customization or last
  local mode. Owner and public views call the same window and conversation
  projection, so later visibility rules—such as meaningful documentation
  edits—take effect in both places.
- Live public shares use the normal session viewport's follow machinery.
  Incoming output follows while the viewer remains at the live edge (including
  its near-bottom continuation band); scrolling away preserves the reading
  position and adds **Follow** to the floating control cluster. Frozen shares
  show the Conversation toggle but no Follow action.

## Time and count semantics

The duration is an **elapsed activity span**, never CPU time, focused-work time,
or billing time. For a completed assistant turn it spans the earliest to latest
observed source-message timestamps in that turn. While the latest assistant turn
is active, its end is the current client clock.

The count is the number of activities hidden by this view. A tool parent counts
its ordered semantic display actions when the provider projection supplies
them; otherwise each hidden render item counts once. Media and retained
failure rows are not included because they are still visible.

## Deferred: meaningful documentation prose

There is a plausible middle ground between hiding every edit and showing raw
code-edit machinery: a documentation edit authored by the agent can itself be
conversation-relevant prose. This is deliberately **not v1 behavior** because a
filename or tool name alone cannot reliably distinguish prose from generated,
mechanical, or code-like changes.

A future implementation should prefer a compact `document name + bounded added
prose` card, with the whole edit block available only on expansion. It may emit
that card only when all of these are true:

- the target is classified as documentation by a conservative path/type policy
  (for example Markdown or another explicitly registered prose format), not
  merely because the filename happens to contain `doc`;
- the provider/compiler supplies trustworthy structured edit hunks and target
  paths, rather than YA scraping terminal output or rendered DOM;
- added lines are predominantly prose and fit a bounded excerpt after removing
  diff markers; code fences, generated sections, bulk formatting, vendored
  text, and large mechanical rewrites fail closed;
- the excerpt is agent-authored addition, not surrounding source context,
  deleted text, command output, or user-authored content.

When a doc edit is meaningful but no safe excerpt can be derived, the compact
form may say `Document edited: <name>`. Open questions are the excerpt bound,
whether multiple doc hunks form one card, and how to mark mixed prose/code
documents. Images remain ordinary visible media associated with the turn; this
extension must not absorb them into edit summaries.

## Implementation boundary

The history-window projection and `projectConversationView` run after the
stable provider transcript projection and before turn grouping, timeline rows,
search, and React rendering. The window selects a user-turn-aligned suffix;
`projectConversationView` then adds a synthetic `conversation_activity` render
item rather than hiding DOM nodes. This keeps owner/public behavior, ordering,
media retention, search scope, progressive rendering, and scroll anchoring
attached to the same render-item model as the full transcript.

**Grow within a block, reset between blocks** (vs. an exponential moving
average over recent blocks): a complete thinking turn is normally only a few
seconds, so an occasional reset/reflow is acceptable. Slot-local monotonic
growth gives stable streaming layout while letting two later compact blocks
return to one row promptly.
