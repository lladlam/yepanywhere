Topic: source-control

The original implementation grew out of
[Source Review → New Session](source-review-to-session.md). That topic remains
the contract for line-comment anchors, persistent review drafts, relocation,
submission, and review-session handoff. This topic is the current landing site
for behavior that belongs to Source Control generally: its modes, repository
navigation, master-detail layout, changed-file rows, diff controls, search,
compatibility shell, and links to relevant sessions. The old topic retains its
combined implementation record for historical context; where its page-wide UI
statements conflict with this topic, this topic governs.

## Product boundary

Source Control is primarily an inspection and agent-direction surface, not a
full git client. Check refreshes remote-tracking observation; fast-forward-only
Pull and explicit Push are the narrow established repository mutations.
Staging, committing, amending, discarding, branch surgery, stash mutation,
integration, conflict resolution, and recovery remain agent work unless a
separate proposal justifies one operation's preconditions, feedback, and
recovery.

The navigation surface has four modes:

- **Changes** is the default quick check and presents the current
  HEAD-to-filesystem changed-file list and diff.
- **Commits** is revision-first history. A dirty **Working tree** revision is
  pinned above commits and opens the same working-tree file/diff detail.
- **Files** searches tracked paths and opens file content immediately, then
  enriches its blame column asynchronously when provenance becomes available.
- **Comments** is the integration point for the pending review workflow owned
  by [Source Review → New Session](source-review-to-session.md).

Desktop uses master-detail panes; phone layouts drill from revisions to files
to a full-screen diff and restore the prior list position on Back or
back-swipe. Changes remains the default until a separately approved change;
making its Working tree view available in Commits does not itself authorize a
default flip.

## Workbench geometry

Source Control is a workbench, not prose or a transcript. It must use the
available page width after ordinary page padding and must not inherit the
Appearance **Max Content Width** measure globally or on its detail panes. The
revision, changed-files, diff, and blame tracks may use all available width.

On wide layouts, the browser region fills the page space remaining after the
actual Source Control header, notices, and action feedback. Lists and
diff/blame panes own their internal scrolling. Fixed viewport deductions such
as `100vh - 220px` are not the product contract, and the blank space they
currently create is not reserved for later content. Phone layout may continue
using normal page and full-screen-modal scrolling.

### Pane splitters

Commits exposes revision/files and files/diff boundaries; Changes and Files
expose their files/detail boundary. Matching top and bottom handles resize the
same boundary, remain keyboard-operable, and stay absent from phone layout.

The changed-files pane has no arbitrary fixed maximum such as 500 px. It may
grow until the inter-pane gap and splitter handles would cease to remain fully
visible and operable; do not reserve an unrelated minimum width for the detail
pane. The user naturally stops after exposing as much path text as desired,
and the still-visible splitter is the recovery path from an extreme choice.

A content-derived natural maximum is optional, not required. If added, compute
it from the widest untruncated row in the **complete file corpus**, including
status, count, and menu affordances—not only rows currently mounted in the
vertical-scroll window. Recompute it when the corpus or relevant font, size,
or spacing metrics change.

### Changed-file state and path recovery

Changed-file rows use the compact git status code as the primary kind:
`M` = Modified, `A` = Added, `D` = Deleted, `R` = Renamed, and `?` =
Untracked. Less common codes retain the same treatment: `C` = Copied, `T` =
Type changed, and `U` = Unmerged. Tooltips and accessible labels expand every
code.

Do not repeat the long, visually similar **unstaged** or **untracked** words on
ordinary rows: the status code already carries the useful distinction, with
unstaged as the ordinary dirty state and `?` identifying untracked files. A
compact check may identify a fully staged file. When a file has staged changes
plus additional unstaged changes, use the explicit short label **partial**
rather than the opaque `±`; its tooltip says “Partially staged: staged changes
plus additional unstaged changes.”

Changes, Commits, and Files use one shared file-row/path treatment. A truncated
path exposes its full value from the actual row hover/focus target in both
Native and Themed tooltip modes; a nested `title` that happens to work in only
one mode is not sufficient. Touch layouts preserve more path identity in the
row itself rather than depending on hover.

### Diff gutter

Added/deleted line backgrounds remain subdued while the `+` / `−` strip carries
the stronger semantic color. The authored gutter is about 16 px wide with a
roughly 6 px inline inset and separate breathing room between the color divide
and source text.

Source Control and session Edit-tool diffs use the same gutter-alignment class;
neither surface may keep a separately tuned approximation. The same shared
boundary owns the diff-specific Shiki palette. Each shipped theme uses fixed,
uniform added and removed line fills, and every syntax token has at least 3.5:1
contrast against both fills. This deliberately softer threshold keeps syntax
roles distinct from ordinary body text while preventing illegible combinations
such as a dim comment on a tinted line. Contrast is audited from the theme
palette offline, never inferred from the current file's content. Highlighted
and fallback renderers retain the contract in unified and side-by-side modes.
The stronger `+` / `−` gutter tints have separately audited foregrounds at the
same minimum, including the session fixed-font rendered form.

Source text is source text regardless of entry point. Source Control diffs,
session Edit-tool diffs, Files content, and blame use the same fixed-font
family, size, and line-spacing tokens derived from Appearance settings.
Individual source surfaces may add local density offsets, but may not substitute
a separately sized or spaced monospace style.

## Navigation and diff controls

One selected row drives the adjacent detail. Identity and state stay visible
in list rows; primary quick actions belong in the selected detail banner; one
shared ellipsis/context menu discloses the full action set. Right-click,
long-press, the visible ellipsis, and Shift+F10/Menu open the same accessible
menu with focus return and keyboard traversal.

Source lists support Up/Down selection, Enter drill-in, Escape return, and `/`
to focus search when focus is outside an editor. Diff navigation supports
previous/next hunk and a visible current-hunk indicator. Browser shortcuts must
not copy native GitHub Desktop accelerators that collide with browser tabs,
Find, or the address bar.

Unified/Split and full-context controls stay in the diff pane. Ignore
whitespace is an independent projection of the active working-tree, commit, or
selected-revision-to-HEAD diff. Selected revision → HEAD uses a fixed selected
tree as base and a pinned HEAD SHA as tip; every file request stays on those
returned endpoints so a later HEAD move cannot mix comparisons.

A comparison comment cites the endpoint that contains the clicked projection:
an old-side line anchors to the fixed base SHA and a new-side line anchors to
the pinned tip SHA. An ordinary one-commit diff uses that commit SHA for both
sides; a working-tree diff remains uncommitted. Rendered diff lines are
interactive on their first visible frame—first-click commenting and hunk keys
do not depend on a later passive effect. Pending-comment tint uses revision,
side, and line identity so similarly numbered lines in another projection do
not inherit it.

Full context is a view of the current diff, not a file-path cache entry. If a
live working-tree refresh changes the diff while full context is open, YA
invalidates and reloads that projection. An older request resolving later
cannot overwrite the newer projection.

The wide diff pane keeps filename, path, view controls, hunk navigation, and
file actions in one toolbar row when they fit. A narrow pane or phone modal may
use a compact second row.

## Search and compatibility

Files search owns the complete tracked-path corpus up to the explicit 10,000
file bound; rendering may window results but must not turn that window into a
search-coverage limit. Commit-delta search builds an on-demand client corpus
from lightweight history plus bounded changed-path/line batches. Once a corpus
is present, typing performs no network request and starts no git process.
Browser-lifetime reuse is implemented; IndexedDB reuse across browser restarts
remains optional future work. Focused completions and rendered match-context
tooltips remain pending.

Files starts its ordinary project-file request and blame request independently.
Readable content renders as soon as the file request returns; the view never
holds it behind `git blame`. Until blame resolves, the gutter shows inert
placeholders and line commenting waits for a provenance anchor. Blame then
fills commit-hash links in place and may add highlighting without resetting the
file selection or scroll context. Failure to load blame leaves readable content
visible with a provenance warning.

A committed hash opens that exact revision in Commits, including a revision
outside the recent page. Its tooltip shows the full SHA, author/date when
known, and commit summary. Right-click, long-press, and the shared keyboard menu
offer **Open commit** and **Copy commit hash**; copying uses the full SHA.
Uncommitted lines remain visibly non-link provenance. Pending blame-comment
tint matches both the line and its committed/uncommitted revision identity.

The blame grid has three real columns: a five-character displayed commit hash,
a content-sized line number, and selectable code. Clicking the line number or
clicking code without selecting it starts a review comment; completing a text
selection does not turn the release click into a review action. Consecutive
lines with the same populated blame provenance share one horizontal overflow
region. Different commits never share that scrollbar, and code cells do not
grow independent per-line scrollbars.

The path-copy icon sits beside the pathname. The detail banner's trailing
document-copy icon instead copies the exact raw text returned by the file
endpoint and remains disabled until readable text is available. Their icons,
tooltips, and accessible names distinguish path from content.

One-author files retain the ordinary gray hash. With multiple authors, hashes
receive distinct hues chosen by maximum minimum distance over the visible
author set. The server gives each author a durable project-wide hue preference
and refreshes the palette in the background when a project is opened or added;
new HEAD commits only scan the newly reachable range. A palette read, update,
or write error discards persisted detail and permits exactly one full-history
regeneration attempt, then omits server palette detail rather than retrying in
a loop. The client re-spaces the visible file's author set from those
preferences. When palette generation fails or an older server omits the
optional preference, a stable author-name hash supplies the preference without
an unsupported request.

Files caches the selected file's maximum intrinsic rendered code-line width by
project, path, content fingerprint, and the typography metrics that affect
measurement. On a wide layout, selection or a relevant viewport/typography
change targets the content pane at the blame gutter, line-number gutter,
scrollbar/border allowance, and that maximum line width—just enough to show the
file without gratuitous empty space—and leaves the remainder to the file list.

The allocator clamps to available space and existing pane minima. It may shrink
an oversized file list toward its ordinary default when that lets the content
fit, but uses a list the user manually narrowed below that default as its
automatic lower bound. A manual split remains in effect until file selection or
the measured viewport/typography changes. Phone layouts keep their full-screen
drill-in and do not run this two-pane allocation. Tests cover cache reuse and
invalidation, tabs/wide characters and empty files, wide-space allocation, and
constrained minimum-width fallback.

**Persist project-wide author preferences, then re-space the visible file**
(vs storing a final color per author): the durable preference keeps identity
stable while file-local maximum-distance assignment preserves useful
distinction for the usually small visible author set. Regenerating only after
an error keeps corrupt state recoverable without turning palette maintenance
into a background retry loop.

The permanent `git-source-review` capability currently gates the complete
Changes/Commits/Files/Comments browser as well as the review endpoints. An
older server with only `git-status-enhanced` receives the basic status,
working-tree diff, and independently advertised Check/Pull/Push shell; the
client makes no unsupported browse/review requests. Ignore whitespace and
selected-revision-to-HEAD comparison remain gated by
`git-source-review-projections`. See
[server capabilities](server-capabilities.md) and
[`063-source-control-hosted-compatibility.md`](../docs/tactical/063-source-control-hosted-compatibility.md).

## Dirty-file editor sessions — proposal

Kyle suggested a button to **“navigate to session(s) that made edits to this
dirty file”**; graehl agrees (2026-07-28). This reverses the existing bridge
from a session Edit block into the exact dirty file. In Changes, the selected
file banner and shared file context menu expose a compact `Sessions (N)`
action. One candidate may navigate directly; more than one opens a
newest-evidence-first chooser using the standard session identity, hovercard,
and canonical YA-session navigation.

Git records no dirty-file session authorship. The deliberately bounded
contract is **sessions with recorded edits**: successful structured file
mutations YA observed in a canonical session—Edit, Write, `apply_patch`, or a
provider equivalent—whose normalized project-relative target is this path.
Do not infer candidates from active sessions, project membership, or file
mtime.

Shell commands, generators, human edits, external processes, and provider
activity YA did not observe may remain unattributed. An unobserved writer can
also replace or revert an observed session's contribution while leaving the
path dirty, so a stale candidate can remain until the file next becomes clean.
This accepted limitation bounds implementation effort; the UI never claims the
set is exhaustive or that every listed session contributed to the exact
current contents.

Implementation plan:

1. Characterize each supported provider's structured file-mutation events and
   success boundary. For `apply_patch`, parse every Add, Update, Delete, and
   Move header; after a successful multi-file patch, upsert one row for each
   touched normalized path. Ignore failed or merely proposed mutations.
2. Persist logical rows of
   `(source, project, normalized file, canonical YA session, latest edit time)`.
   A later successful edit by the same session to the same file only replaces
   that row's time. Retain no event history, tool/message ids, content hashes,
   transcript backfill, or before/after lineage. Store the set in private
   server-owned state and reload it after process restart; it has no TTL or
   bounded-retention expiry. Its lifecycle ends at authoritative clean-state
   reconciliation, not elapsed time.
3. Reconcile only from a successful, complete, authoritative Git-status
   refresh. Whenever such a refresh observes that a tracked path has become not
   dirty, clear every row for that file. A successful commit normally causes
   this transition, but
   a commit that leaves further staged or unstaged changes does not: the
   clearing condition is observed clean file state, not a commit command.
   Restart performs the same reconciliation for every reachable project.
   Temporary source/project disconnect retains rows and does not pretend that
   files became clean; reconnect reconciles before serving them. Explicit
   project removal clears that project's rows, and explicit source removal
   clears all rows owned by that source.
4. Add a capability-gated query for remaining candidate session summaries,
   ordered by latest recorded edit, and reuse the existing session
   hovercard/navigation and file banner/menu.
5. Test one and several sessions, repeated edits deduplicating to latest time,
   failed edits being ignored, clean-state clearing, restart persistence and
   reconciliation, disconnect/reconnect retention, explicit project/source
   removal, a commit that leaves the file dirty, and accepted missing/stale
   attribution after unobserved shell or human changes.

**Difficulty:** the UI is low difficulty. Provider mutation hooks, clean-state
observation, the small tuple set, and its query are low-to-medium difficulty.
Exact lineage and exhaustive attribution are deliberately out of scope.
