# Source Review → New Session

> Source Review → New Session is the Source Control workflow that accumulates
> line-anchored comments as persistent drafts, relocates them against current
> source, and submits each chosen batch to a new or existing agent session.

Topic: source-review-to-session

Parent topic: [Source Control](source-control.md).

Status: **stages 1–3 implemented** (2026-07-26), including the P8 diff view
mode. The pending set is browsable as a **Comments mode tab** (list, delete,
jump-to-blame, submit) beside changes/commits/files. The first GitHub
Desktop-inspired review-navigation slice is implemented (2026-07-27): Commits
includes a shared dirty Working tree revision, source lists support keyboard
traversal/search, and diff hunk navigation is symmetric. The follow-up
refinement (2026-07-28) adds one accessible action-menu contract across
revisions, files, and diff lines; a compact shortcut card; and edge-only,
keyboard-accessible desktop pane splitters. The same refinement now includes
independent Ignore whitespace and selected-revision-to-HEAD diff projections.
Design owner: graehl.

## Origin

Prompted by [kzahel/yepanywhere#95](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/issues/95):
a contributor shipped a polished file browser plus full git management (branch
switch, log, changes, stash, history, fetch/commit/push). kzahel deliberately
kept YA's git surface minimal — pull/push/refresh only — because he lets agents
do committing and conflict resolution and rarely takes manual git actions. The
contributor then named the part that actually earns its keep: the viewer is a
**bridge for directing agents**, not a repo-management console. Their two live
use cases were (1) grab exact file names / relative paths to feed an agent, and
(2) read the git log to grab a branch name or commit hash so they can tell the
agent "look at what changed in *this* commit and adapt."

This proposal takes that bridge framing as the whole point and adds the piece a
detailed reviewer wants: **comment on diff lines, then hand the whole review to
a fresh agent** — the review-tool interaction (Gerrit/GitHub line comments)
minus any obligation to perform the git actions yourself.

![3-column recent-changes browser (kzahel/yepanywhere#95)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chenxiccc/yepanywhere/assets/screenshots/source-manager/git-management-04.webp)

*Reference layout (kzahel/yepanywhere#95, the contributor's Source Manager): a
3-column recent-changes browser — commit list · changed files · unified diff. A
side-by-side diff option would make it 4 columns. Linked to the upstream asset
rather than committed, to avoid polluting the repo.*

**Reference implementation, not a template.** The issue #95 submitter's
archived
[`source-file-manager-v3` branch](https://github.com/chenxiccc/yepanywhere/tree/archive/source-file-manager-v3)
is useful for interaction and layout inspiration only. Do not copy it wholesale:
it is deliberately more feature-rich than YA's goals here, especially around
file and git management. Any borrowed idea must first pass this topic's
review-first, agent-directing scope.

## Design stance

- **Review-first; Pull/Push are narrow exceptions.** Inspection, copying, and
  composing an agent turn are the surface's center. The established remote
  controls are Check, Pull, and Push: Check refreshes remote-tracking
  observation; fast-forward-only Pull and explicit Push are the only manual
  operations presented as repository state changes. Commit, stage, branch,
  stash, integration, conflict, and destructive/recovery work stays with
  agents. This is a deliberate safety and workflow decision, not an
  implementation limitation: even when a button would be trivial to wire, an
  attentive agent can inspect preconditions, preserve unrelated work, explain
  the exact operation, and adapt or recover when the repository is not in the
  expected state.
- **Compose, don't act.** The output of a review is never a git operation; it is
  a **review session turn** — a new session, or a follow-up to a recent review
  session — carrying the reviewer's comments and the code they were about. The
  reviewer directs; the agent acts.
- **One surface, two modes — both accumulate.** "Source control" is a single
  surface with two navigation modes that feed the **same** comment accumulator:
  (1) the working-tree (uncommitted) diff and recent commits / diffs (the
  primary review flow — reviewing an agent's dirty worktree *before* it commits
  is the hottest supervision moment), and (2) an **all-files
  git-blame browser** — open any project file, not just recently-changed ones,
  with blame giving each line its originating commit. Clicking a blamed line
  opens the same comment window. The all-files browser is a subsection/mode of
  source control, **not a standalone feature**.
- **Line comments, implied context — no precise selection.** You click a diff
  line to open a comment window; you do **not** drag-select an exact span to
  limit context. It is implied that the nearby context is what the comment is
  about, and the tool includes it. This is deliberate: hand-delimiting spans is
  friction, and "the code around this line" is almost always the intent. The
  payload carries a small immediate snippet inline plus references for larger
  context (see the seeded-turn contract below), never a reviewer-chosen span.
- **Large-screen, multipane — with a first-class mobile path.** The design
  target is a smooth, large-screen multipane layout (like the #95 branch
  screenshots): navigate recent commit(s) in one pane, read a diff in another,
  comment on various diff lines as you go. Mobile is not an afterthought: a
  back-swipe-navigable version, with a small selector to jump between commits,
  stays usable for reading diffs and leaving comments on the go.
- **Build on existing surfaces, don't rebuild.**
  - [selection-comment-ui](selection-comment-ui.md) — select text → `>`
    blockquote into the composer with a green comment-anchor tint. It is the
    quote-comment *ancestor*, but the gesture here differs: **click a diff line →
    comment window**, not drag-select, and the destination is a persistent
    pending review, not the live draft. The comment-anchor tint (marking a line
    that already has a draft comment) still applies.
  - `GitStatusPage` / `GitStatusDiffPreview` / `routes/git-status.ts` — the
    existing read-only status + diff viewer to grow the multipane commit/diff
    browsing from.
  - [local-file-source-highlighting](local-file-source-highlighting.md) —
    Shiki-highlighted previews via the authenticated local-file route, for the
    file-viewer half and the highlighted diff.
  - Path/link affordances graehl noted: any path mentioned in a session is
    already viewable and any file link is already copyable — the viewer makes
    those first-class rather than incidental.
  - [floating-new-session-composer](floating-new-session-composer.md) — prior
    art for composing a first turn from a non-session page; the submit
    endpoint owns the actual launch (see the implementation sketch).

## Core feature: the accumulating review (the vision)

This is the actual proposal, not the one-off below. It is a Gerrit-style set of
**draft comments that persist and accumulate** — across files, across diff lines
within a commit, and across the tree as it keeps changing under them — until a
single "submit review" drains *every not-yet-consumed comment at once* into one
review session. The value is that a reviewer works over a change at their own
pace, leaving line comments as they go, and only later hands the whole
considered review to an agent in one shot.

There is deliberately **no Gerrit-style patch-set or change-identity concept**:
plain git has no stable identity for "the same change" across amends and
successive commits (no Change-Id machinery here), and everything patch-sets
would buy is already covered by per-comment anchoring revisions plus
submit-time relocation below.

- **Comment on a line.** Clicking a diff line — on either the `-` (removed) or
  `+` (added) side — or a blamed line in all-files mode opens a comment window
  anchored to that line; its provenance follows the rules below. No exact-span
  selection; the tool carries a small immediate snippet and references for the
  rest (see the seeded-turn contract).
- **Anchors and drift.** Each comment anchors to `{ repo-relative path,
  anchoring revision, line, nearby-context snippet }`. The anchoring revision
  is one of: the reviewed commit's SHA, the blame line's origin SHA, the HEAD
  SHA at comment time (the all-files "as of HEAD" case), or **uncommitted** —
  a working-tree change with no SHA, labeled `uncommitted` and timestamped.
  Drafts live for hours or days while agents keep committing, so anchors
  drift: lines move, change, or vanish. At **submit time, per comment**, the
  anchor is relocated against the current tree — exact line match first, then
  a fuzzy context-snippet match (patch-hunk style). An `uncommitted` anchor
  whose change has since been committed acquires that commit's SHA and
  relocates the same way.
- **Provenance, and when the generated message cites a SHA.** The generated
  message states the SHA **only when relocation fails** — the commented line no
  longer exists in the current tree, so the agent needs the commit to locate
  the historical line. When relocation succeeds, the message omits the SHA and
  gives path + current line + snippet; the agent can run `git blame` itself if
  it wants provenance. This keeps the seeded turn lean and only cites commits
  the agent actually needs. A comment on the `-` (removed) side of a diff is by
  definition about code no longer in the tree, so its SHA is **implied and
  always cited** (a concrete case of the relocation rule). For diff comments
  the message can also frame the change as *from X to Y*, where X and Y are the
  clicked line plus a few surrounding lines in the old and new versions
  respectively — so the agent sees the before/after region, not just the single
  side that was clicked.
- **Submit preview; stale comments default to discard.** "Submit review" first
  shows a preview of every pending comment. Comments whose context no longer
  exists (relocation failed) are listed **first**, pre-selected **discard** —
  it is usually too late to act on them — but the reviewer can override and
  include any of them (each then carries its SHA citation), since discussion
  of history can still inform present state.
- **Pending → consumed (archived) lifecycle.** A comment is *pending*
  (unconsumed) from creation until a review is submitted. Submit gathers the
  pending comments that survived the preview, composes one review turn,
  delivers it, and **archives** those comments as consumed: they stay visible
  on their anchors and in an archive list, linked to the session they went to —
  so "did I already comment on this?" has an answer — and the next submit will
  not resend them. Comments added afterward form the next pending review. A
  visible pending count (like unsent Gerrit drafts) is the reviewer's cue to
  what a submit would carry.
- **Submit target: recent review session by default.** When a review session
  was recently started from this surface, submit defaults to delivering the
  new batch to it as a **follow-up turn** — that agent already holds the
  earlier review context. The submit flow lets the user override: pick any
  existing session manually, or opt for a fresh one. Existing choices identify
  their provider/model; a fresh session exposes provider and model choices
  explicitly. "Recent" is a default, not a gate; absent a prior review session,
  the most recently updated project session is a reasonable follow-up default.
  Each consumed batch records which session it went to.
- **The seeded turn: short prompt + review file, small snippets inline.** The
  delivered turn is a short prompt — naming what this is (a source review),
  instructing the agent to address each comment and report per-comment
  dispositions, and explicitly instructing it to read current file state
  rather than trusting quoted snippets — referencing a **project-local `.yep`
  review-comments file** that carries the structured comments (a follow-up
  turn references the same file updated with the new batch). Each comment
  gives path + line + anchoring revision plus a **small immediate snippet
  inline**: inline context lets a human reading the transcript comprehend the
  review, and makes the agent less likely to miss the immediate context — at
  the known risk that the agent settles for the snippet instead of reading the
  larger context, which the read-current-state instruction counters. Larger
  context stays by reference; for a non-current revision the agent views it
  with git commands.
- **Where drafts live: server-owned, in the project's `.yep/` dir.**
  Relocation, blame, and submit composition all need server git access, so
  the server owns the drafts and is the single authority for
  pending/archived state — a review started on the desktop continues on the
  phone with the same pending set and archive. Storage is a git-ignored
  project-local `.yep/review-comments.json` per the agreed `.yep/`
  YA-managed-state home ([interactives](interactives.md)): the project path
  is the keying (two repos' drafts can never mix), the drafts follow the
  checkout they annotate, and the file sits exactly where the seeded
  prompt's review file must live, so submit composes largely by reference.
  The client holds only UI state (the open comment window's in-progress text
  may keep a localStorage backup, like message drafts).

## One-off diff-line comment → session (a fast path, not the vision)

A direct "click a line, comment, start a session with just that now" shortcut
is worth having for a quick single question. It is **defined as the accumulator
containing one comment, drained immediately** — same store, same submit
machinery and never a parallel code path. Submitting either way consumes only
that one comment, leaving the rest of the pending review untouched. Do not
mistake shipping this shortcut for delivering the accumulating review — the
vision is the multi-comment, drain-all-unconsumed flow.

**Edit block → dirty file.** Each session Edit tool block with a usable project
file offers **Review**. The link opens that project's Source Control
in Changes at the exact edited Working tree file. The session containing the
link becomes the **default session** for that Source Control browser-history
entry. Back/forward and navigation among Source Control modes preserve it; a
deliberate project switch clears it. This default is tab-local navigation
history, not server or project recency: activity in another tab, browser,
device, or session cannot retarget it.

**Two distinct immediate-submit actions.** The comment window always offers
**Submit to new session**. When the page has an Edit-link default session, it
also offers **Submit to current session**. Hovering that action shows the
standard session hovercard for the exact destination (opening request, recent
reply when available, provider/model, project, age, and status), with the
Edit-link-captured session identity as its fallback when live summary data is
not yet available.

- **Submit to current session** sends the composed review turn directly to
  that exact existing session. It does not consult recent sessions or prior
  review batches.
- **Submit to new session** starts a separate session using the default
  session's provider, model, thinking mode, and effort. When Source Control was
  not opened from a session Edit link, the default-session action is absent and
  the new session uses the normal launch defaults.

**A background refresh never owns the editor.** Once the reviewer opens a
line-comment editor, status polling and diff refreshes must not dismiss it,
clear its text, replace its captured anchor, or move focus away. This includes
an actually changed diff and a refresh in which the selected file or the whole
dirty Working tree disappears. While the target remains addressable, the live
diff continues refreshing behind the mounted editor; this contract is not
implemented by suppressing equivalent polls. If the target disappears, the
last selected file/diff stays pinned until the reviewer cancels or successfully
submits. Queueing or submit failure leaves the editor and text intact.

**The delivered turn quotes captured context.** A dirty-line draft captures
the clicked line plus nearby context when the editor opens because the file can
shift before submit. Submit relocates that anchor against current state and the
user turn always includes a fenced context quote: current relocated context
when found, or the original captured snippet when gone, plus the path/current
line or historical citation as applicable. The turn also explicitly tells the
agent to read current file state rather than treating the quote as
authoritative.

## Historical combined Source Control scope

The current page-wide navigation and layout contract lives in
[Source Control](source-control.md). This section is retained as the original
combined implementation record; Source Control governs if its current contract
differs.

The polished viewer graehl wanted, kept read-only except for the established
Pull/Push actions:

- **Repo/branch status bar.** At tablet/desktop widths, one small persistent
  top row carries project identity, current branch, sync/dirty state, source
  modes, and the Review entry point. A **yellow warning when the worktree is
  dirty or the branch is out of sync** (ahead/behind its upstream) stays
  visible without spending a second toolbar row. On phone widths only the
  small project header persists; repo state, modes, and review controls may
  wrap into scrolling rows and must scroll away with content. The surface
  exposes status and the established Check/Pull/Push actions, not the deferred
  manual operations in Non-goals.
- **Changes-first today; converge without removing the quick check.** Source
  Control currently lands on **Changes** at every viewport, preserving Kyle's
  accustomed-to quick-check experience. Changes owns the current
  HEAD-to-filesystem view: one row per changed path,
  staged/unstaged/both/untracked state, and the same diff/comment stack with
  `uncommitted` anchors. It also keeps a read-only recent-commits list in the
  quick-check view, including beside a quiet clean state. The intended
  direction is to make Changes gradually redundant by making a dirty
  **Working tree** revision in Commits equally immediate and useful, while
  preserving Changes as the dedicated fast path during that convergence.
  Changing the default landing to Commits happens only after that dirty-tree
  path is approved as useful on both mobile and desktop and Kyle gives the
  go-ahead. Until then, Commits contains actual commits only, and the Dirty
  status badge returns to Changes.
- Multipane commit/diff navigation: browse recent commit(s), history/log, and a
  commit's diff **without switching branches**.
  The reference layout above is a **3-column** browser (commits · files ·
  diff); the diff pane renders **unified or side-by-side** per the
  diff-view-mode decision below, side-by-side reading as a 4-column layout.
  From a commit's diff you can switch to an **"as of HEAD" content view
  centered on the diff region, with a blame gutter** — bridging the
  commit-review mode into the all-files/blame provenance.
- Rudimentary search across recent commit **delta (diff) text and/or filenames**
  — enough to find the commit or file you want to comment on. This is a generic
  browser facility, captured here as part of this surface by design intent.
- All-files mode: file tree + search + highlighted file viewing (reuse Shiki per
  local-file-source-highlighting), with **git blame** so any line can be clicked
  to comment into the same review — a mode of this surface, not a standalone
  browser.
- Copy affordances: file name, absolute path, relative path, branch name, commit
  hash — the non-mutating subset of the #95 context menu.
- Mobile: Changes shows its file list and opens a selected diff full-screen.
  Commits is master/detail navigation: commit list → selected commit files →
  full-screen diff, with explicit and back-swipe navigation restoring the
  previous level and list position. Selected files never render after the
  complete history list. The small commit-jump selector remains available in
  commit detail (the #95 branch showed mobile matters).

## Non-goals

- No manual git-state-changing actions beyond Pull/Push. In particular, no
  staging, commit/amend, restore/discard/reset, branch switch or creation,
  stash mutation, merge/rebase/cherry-pick/revert, conflict workflow, tag, or
  rename/delete operation is currently planned. When one of those changes is
  wanted, the user asks an agent to perform it with repository-specific
  attention.
- No precise span selection to limit context — anchoring is per-line with implied
  nearby context, by design.
- Not a replacement for agent-driven git; not a full IDE or a second VS Code;
  not a general file manager (the #95 rename/delete items are intentionally
  unimplemented).

## Design decisions

- **Uncommitted provenance class** (vs. commit-only anchors): the hottest
  supervision moment is reviewing an agent's dirty worktree before it commits,
  and the existing GitStatusDiffPreview foundation is exactly that view; an
  anchor class with no SHA (labeled `uncommitted`, timestamped) covers it.
- **Changes-to-Commits convergence is approval-gated** (vs. either permanent
  duplicate investment or an immediate default flip): keep Changes as Kyle's
  accustomed-to quick-check surface while Commits grows a dirty Working tree
  landing that can make it redundant. Do not change the default until the
  candidate is approved as useful on mobile and desktop and Kyle gives the
  go-ahead.
- **Submit-time relocation, SHA cited only on failure** (vs. citing every
  comment's commit): lean seeded turns; the agent needs a SHA only when the
  line is gone from the current tree.
- **No patch-set/change-identity concept** (vs. Gerrit-style revisions): plain
  git has no stable change identity across amends and successive commits;
  anchoring revisions plus relocation cover draft survival.
- **Stale comments default to discard at submit preview** (vs. silently
  including or dropping them): usually too late to act on, so pre-selected
  discard and listed first — but overridable, since discussion of history can
  inform present state.
- **Server-owned drafts from v1** (vs. a client-only `localStorage`
  accumulator graduating to the server later): every git-state operation the
  feature needs already passes through the server, so putting drafts there is
  the simpler build, not the harder one — and device-switching during a long
  review makes server authority the right semantics anyway. One owner for
  consumed/archived state; no schema graduation step.
- **Drafts stored in project-local `.yep/`** (vs. a data-dir store keyed by a
  project mapping): follows the established `.yep/` YA-managed-state
  convention, gets per-project keying from the path itself, keeps drafts
  with the worktree they annotate, and co-locates them with the review file
  the seeded prompt references.
- **Diff view mode: one three-valued preference, `auto | unified |
  side-by-side`, defaulting to `auto`** (vs. a bare side-by-side boolean, or
  side-by-side always): graehl mildly prefers side-by-side, but the default
  is whatever the width allows — `auto` picks side-by-side exactly when the
  diff pane measures wide enough for two readable code columns, else
  unified. "Wide enough" is a content measurement of the pane against a
  minimum readable code column, not a viewport breakpoint
  ([responsive-layout-gaps](responsive-layout-gaps.md)). The manual toggle
  lives **in the diff pane itself** (beside the existing full-context
  toggle) so the mode is switchable on the spot, and it persists as a
  **device-local browser preference** — screen sizes vary per device, so
  this is typically set once per device and does not travel between them.
  One mode value, not coupled booleans.
- **Default submit target = recent review session** (vs. always a new
  session): round-2 comments continue the round-1 conversation; the submit
  flow still lets the user pick any existing session or a fresh one.
- **Archive consumed comments** (vs. delete): answers "did I already comment
  on this?", keeps history, and links each batch to the session it went to.
- **Short prompt + project-local `.yep` review file, small snippets inline**
  (vs. pasting full context into the turn): the structured comments travel in
  a file the prompt references, keeping the transcript readable; small inline
  snippets serve human comprehension and immediate-context safety, and the
  prompt instructs the agent to read current file state rather than trust
  them.
- **Blame cache keyed by (commit SHA, path)** (vs. mtime keying, vs. a
  cumulative all-history blame index): blame is a pure function of (commit,
  path); mtime false-invalidates on touch and can miss same-second edits; a
  cumulative index is probably too large. Dirty files have no SHA for current
  content, so they key on a content hash — or mtime as the cheap freshness
  check — or skip caching.

## Historical combined Source Control UI record

The current page-wide UI contract and pending general refinements live in
[Source Control](source-control.md). The detailed record below explains the
implemented review-led evolution but is not the landing site for new general
Source Control behavior.

The multipane source browser's presentation contracts, refined from live
review. Each is a spec a reviewer can verify; the status marker cites the
landing commit, or "pending" for a spec built out here but not yet
implemented.

### Rows identify; detail banners act; ellipses disclose

List rows reserve their main area for always-visible identity and state
(subject/path, comment-count badge, read/unread weight). Primary quick actions
route through the selected item's detail-pane banner. A compact trailing
ellipsis may reveal the full shared action menu on row hover/focus and remains
visible on touch layouts; it does not reserve a wide action gutter or duplicate
the banner's quick-action treatment.
Selecting a row is the click already made to see its diff/detail, so actions
cost no extra affordance. — Done (6ecdd938).

- **Commit banner** (files-column header): selected commit's short sha
  (copyable), "mark read to here", "mark unread since here", newer/older jump.
- **File banner** (diff-pane header, via `GitDiffPreview`/`GitDiffModal`
  `headerActions`): copy path, blame-at-HEAD.
- **Blame view header**: copy path.

### Comment-count badges

Every commit row and file row with pending review comments shows a small
always-visible count badge — keyed per commit sha (commit list) and per file
path (file lists). Comments are the priority badge; other counts may join
later "if there is room". — Done (6ecdd938).

### Commit read watermark

A per-project **read watermark** (device-local, `useCommitReadWatermark`)
splits the commit list into unread (bold, newer than the mark) and read
(dimmed, at/older) — the mail convention. "Mark read to here" sets the
boundary to the selected commit's author time; "mark unread since here" drops
it just below, so that commit and everything newer read as unread. Date-based,
not list-position, so it survives paging and search. Nothing is read until a
boundary is set. — Done (6ecdd938).

### Tooltips on truncated text; date in blame

- Truncated commit subjects and file paths carry a `title` tooltip until any
  fuller in-layout treatment lands. — Done (8c9be031).
- Files renders readable content immediately and fills blame asynchronously.
  The populated hash is a commit link; its tooltip is
  `full sha · author · date · summary`, and its shared action menu opens the
  commit or copies the full SHA. Blame failure leaves content visible. —
  Revised 2026-07-28.

### Per-column content width

Each source-browser column caps at `var(--content-max-width)` (the Appearance
> Max Content Width preference), applied **per column** — not one global cap
that would crush a multi-column layout. The diff/blame column is the one that
otherwise grows unbounded; leftover width stays as gutter
(`justify-content: start`), never stretched tracks. — Done (8c9be031).

### One discoverable source header; phone rows scroll

When the row fits (including tablet widths), project identity, repo/branch
state, Changes/Commits/Files/Comments, and an always-visible Review action
compose into one page-header row. There is no second persistent repo toolbar.
Source Control lands on Changes; an absent or unknown `?tab=` value resolves
there until the approval-gated Commits default above is accepted. Pull, Push,
and Check report their result on the control that initiated them; in
particular, a successful remote check is visible on the Check button instead
of creating a separate status row.
Review with no pending comments opens Comments and its "click a line" guidance;
with drafts it opens submit preview directly, so a first-time explorer can
discover the complete comment → review-session path from the header.

Phone widths keep only the small project header fixed. Repo status, tabs, and
Review may use additional rows in the page body, but those rows are ordinary
scrolling content and disappear while reading. Both placements drive the same
`?tab=` URL state (`useSourceTab`). The tab meanings do not change by viewport;
only simultaneous desktop panes become focused mobile navigation. — Revised
2026-07-27; see
[`docs/tactical/064-source-control-responsive-navigation.md`](../docs/tactical/064-source-control-responsive-navigation.md).

### GitHub Desktop review grammar; operations stay options

GitHub Desktop is useful here as learned **review-navigation grammar**, not as
the scope of a native git client. Its Changes and History views consistently
make one selection drive the adjacent file list and diff, keep state and
identity in dense rows, and provide keyboard navigation and contextual
actions. Its manual operations are useful expectation research, but are
intentionally unimplemented options rather than part of the planned redesign.
This is the modest boundary requested in the two closing comments on
[`kzahel/yepanywhere#76`](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/pull/76#issuecomment-5096340400):
use the familiar interface as inspiration while leaving git operations to
agents
([follow-up](https://github.com/kzahel/yepanywhere/pull/76#issuecomment-5096351210)).

**Expected operations, intentionally absent.** A GitHub Desktop user may
reasonably look for:

- stage/unstage, commit, amend, and undo-last-commit;
- restore/discard changes and reset;
- create/apply/pop/drop stash;
- create/switch/rename/delete branch;
- merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert, commit checkout, and conflict
  resolution; and
- compound Fetch/Sync/Publish workflows beyond YA's explicit Check, Pull, and
  Push controls.

These are options YA is in theory open to adding one at a time, not a backlog.
Their implementation is often trivial; that is intentionally not sufficient
reason to expose them. The preferred workflow is to ask an agent to perform a
meaningful state change with full attention to repository state, unrelated
work, remote movement, the intended scope, and recovery. A single-screen
visual summary—however good—does not replace that judgment. Reopen an option
only after real, repeated workflow demand shows that agent delegation is
materially worse; then specify that operation's preconditions, failure
feedback, and recovery before approval. Do not import a completeness bundle
merely because users of a full git client may expect it.

The first convergence slice establishes one **revision-detail model** with two
entry points:

- **Changes remains the quick check.** It opens the Working tree's file/diff
  detail immediately and stays the default while the combined route is
  evaluated. It did not become slower merely to make the two tabs look alike.
- **Commits has a pinned Working tree revision above actual commits when the
  tree is dirty.** Selecting it mounts the same `WorkingTreeBrowser` used by
  Changes, so file merging, staged/unstaged state, diff, comments, and
  `uncommitted` anchors have one implementation. A clean tree starts with
  actual commits.
- **Desktop keeps the existing master-detail progression:** revisions · files
  · diff. The compact Changes path may keep its direct files · diff form.
- **Phone drills in rather than appending detail below history:** revisions →
  selected revision's files → selected file's diff, with an explicit Back at
  each transition. The earlier unified experiment failed because Working tree
  detail appeared after the full commit stream; the repaired commit drill-in
  is the pattern the shared Working tree revision now reuses.
- **The default flip remains separately gated.** An evaluation build or
  default-off option is no longer needed merely to expose the combined route:
  it lives in the existing Commits tab while Changes remains the landing.
  Commits becomes the default only after the dirty-tree route is approved as
  useful on both mobile and desktop and Kyle gives the go-ahead. Changes
  remains available after a flip.

The first review accelerators are small and read-only. Implemented items remain
shared where their owning surface is shared; the rest stay proposals:

1. **List and drill-in keys:** Up/Down moves the active revision or file
   selection, Enter opens its detail on a focused layout, and Escape returns
   one level or clears the active filter. `/` focuses search when focus is not
   in an editor or input. — Implemented 2026-07-27. Enter remains native button
   activation, and the visible `/` keycap teaches the browser-safe shortcut.
2. **Symmetric hunk keys:** keep `n` for next hunk and add `p` for previous.
   The visible previous/current/next toolbar remains the touch path; keyboard
   use is never required. — Implemented 2026-07-27.
3. **One accessible context menu:** right-click, long-press, the visible
   ellipsis, and Shift+F10/Menu all open the same read-only menu specified
   below. — Implemented 2026-07-28 across revisions, working-tree/commit/blame
   file rows, and diff lines. Menu focus starts on the first action; arrow,
   Home/End, and Escape navigation work uniformly.
4. **Diff review controls:** retain Unified/Split and full context. **Ignore
   whitespace** is an independent projection of whichever diff is active:
   ordinary commit, selected revision to HEAD, or working tree. It removes
   whitespace-only changes while preserving the original source text on lines
   that still carry a semantic change. — Implemented 2026-07-28. Incremental
   context expansion remains unbuilt. GitHub Desktop exposes these same review
   projections in its
   [change-review guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop).
5. **Edge-only pane splitters:** desktop revision/file boundaries expose small
   resize handles only at the top and bottom, keeping pane interiors free of a
   full-height hit target. Pointer drag reflows the grid live and reveals the
   full-height guide; Left/Right and Home/End resize the same boundary from
   either handle. Splitters are absent below the desktop layout threshold. —
   Implemented 2026-07-28. A separate focused-pane maximize action remains
   unbuilt.

Do **not** copy GitHub Desktop's accelerators literally. Its native application
uses Command/Control+1 and +2 for Changes/History, Command/Control+L for the
Changes filter, Command/Control+F for Find, and Command/Control+8/+9 for pane
sizing
([shortcut reference](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/github-desktop-keyboard-shortcuts);
[pinned source](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/57d0f8129656978e2b064f4c8d3d9fec7e2e21ee/app/src/main-process/menu/build-default-menu.ts)).
Those combinations collide with ordinary browser tab selection, the address
bar, and browser Find. YA uses the scope-aware keys above. A compact `?`
inside commit search reveals the shortcut card on hover, focus, or click/tap
without adding a toolbar row; both the trigger and card are absent at phone
width, where every action has a touch path. — Implemented 2026-07-28.

A cumulative **selected revision → HEAD** comparison is a toggleable mode, not
arbitrary range selection: the selected commit is the fixed base and the
current HEAD tree is the fixed tip, so one control works on desktop and touch
without introducing selection-range state. The server resolves and returns
both endpoint SHAs with the file list; every file diff then uses those pinned
SHAs, so a later HEAD move cannot mix two comparisons. Selecting HEAD produces
an empty comparison. Merge commits use their resulting tree as the base, not
an invented first-parent commit range or merge-base projection. Comments cite
the endpoint containing the clicked line: old-side anchors use the selected
base SHA and new-side anchors use the pinned HEAD SHA. — Revised 2026-07-28.

— First slice implemented 2026-07-27; remaining options researched against
GitHub Desktop
[`57d0f812`](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/tree/57d0f8129656978e2b064f4c8d3d9fec7e2e21ee)
and live YA desktop/phone captures (2026-07-27).

### Released-server fallback and action feedback

The complete Changes/Commits/Files/Comments browser and source-review workflow
requires the permanent `git-source-review` capability. That capability owns
the commit browse, search, blame, commit-diff, review-comment, preview, and
submit routes plus the extended HEAD-to-filesystem diff fields;
`git-status-enhanced` retains only its previously released status,
untracked-folder, and basic working-tree-diff meaning.

When `git-status-enhanced` exists without `git-source-review`, Source Control
renders a basic compatibility shell instead of an upgrade-only dead end:
repository/branch/upstream/ahead-behind/clean state plus Check, Pull, Push, and
integration analysis according to their existing independent capability
advertisements. It explains that commit history, file browsing, and source
review require a server update. It does not mount a new browse/review component
or call one of its routes.

Ignore whitespace and selected-revision-to-HEAD comparison require the
transitional `git-source-review-projections` capability. Without it, their
controls make no projection request, remain off, and show a dismissible
update-or-restart-server notice; ordinary Source Control continues to work.
If a server advertises the capability but a projection request fails, the
client returns to the ordinary diff and shows the same notice. It never leaves
a projection control active over ordinary or stale content. On phone layouts,
the notice is portaled above the full-screen diff as a dismissible bottom
banner rather than being hidden behind it.

Git action outcomes render twice by design: a brief mark on the initiating
button for immediate attribution and a persistent full-text panel beside the
page content. The panel survives until the next action or project change;
warnings are alerts and successes are status messages. Touch users never need
hover to learn why Pull or Push left the branch unchanged.

The core compatibility corpus initially covers released `v0.6.0`, `v0.6.1`,
`v0.6.2`, and `v0.7.0`. See
[`docs/tactical/063-source-control-hosted-compatibility.md`](../docs/tactical/063-source-control-hosted-compatibility.md).

— Done (2026-07-27).

### Stash triage in history — proposal only

If stashes become common enough to justify a management exception, show an
alert-colored alias for **every existing stash** in a triage group pinned above
the commit history, regardless of stash age or ordinary commit paging/search
horizons. Clicking the alias reveals, scrolls to, and selects that stash at its
actual chronological position in history rather than creating a second
logical entry. A preference may disable the pinned triage aliases and leave
stashes only in chronology, accepting that old stashes will usually go
unnoticed.

The selected chronological entry opens its files and original diff through
the same review browser. Its primary review delta is the stash's saved
working-tree snapshot against its first parent (the `HEAD` commit at stash
creation), and the UI shows and copies that base SHA. The stash's index parent
and optional untracked-files parent remain visible as provenance/facets rather
than silently disappearing or replacing that primary ancestor-to-stash diff.

Dropping a stash would be a new manual-mutation exception beyond Pull/Push and
is an **intentionally unimplemented option**, not approved by this proposal.
If real demand eventually justifies it, "drop" must be recoverable: retain the
stash tip under a YA-owned Git ref before removing it from `refs/stash`, and
append one record to a single `.yep/dropped-stashes.jsonl` audit/recovery log.
The log records the original stash identity, retained ref, tip SHA, message,
and drop time; it cannot itself hold the stash object graph or keep
unreferenced objects alive. The UI must expose recovery and eventual permanent
cleanup, and the exception must be reconciled explicitly with the Non-goals
rather than quietly weakening them.

### Context menus

Right-click (desktop) and long-press (touch) on a commit, file, or
diff/context line opens a menu of *all* logical actions for that target; the
same menu is reachable from a small hamburger/ellipsis affordance (revealed on
mouseover on desktop, always shown on mobile) in the style of the
recent-sessions sidebar item menu. The detail-pane banner stays the
quick-action surface; the context menu is the fuller superset — the
"right-click action" the select-shows-detail design left open. Logical actions
by target:

- **Commit**: copy sha, copy subject, mark read to here, mark unread since
  here, jump newer/older.
- **File** (within a commit): copy path, blame-at-HEAD.
- **Diff / context line**: comment on line (the existing click), copy line
  text, copy `path:line`.

The tracked-files browser uses the same file-row menu with Open file and Copy
path because blame-at-HEAD is already its selected detail.

`SourceContextMenu` owns portal positioning, dismissal, focus return, menu
arrow/Home/End traversal, Shift+F10/Menu, right-click, and the shared 500 ms
touch/pen long-press. Each target supplies only its action list. Diff lines
are keyboard-focusable: Enter opens the existing comment path and Up/Down
moves between rendered lines. Their one ellipsis follows the hovered/focused
line rather than reserving a button on every code row. — Done (2026-07-28).

### Dirty-file editor sessions — proposal

Kyle suggested a button to **"navigate to session(s) that made edits to this
dirty file"**; graehl agrees (2026-07-28). This reverses the useful bridge that
already exists from a session Edit block into the exact dirty file in Source
Control. In Changes, the selected-file banner and shared file context menu
would expose a compact `Sessions (N)` action. It opens a newest-evidence-first
chooser using the normal session identity, hovercard, and canonical YA-session
navigation; it does not invent a second session-row treatment.

Git itself records no dirty-file session authorship. Do not infer it from
currently active sessions, project membership, or file mtime. Defensible
evidence is a successful structured file mutation observed in a canonical YA
session — Edit, Write, `apply_patch`, or a provider-equivalent operation —
whose normalized project-relative target is this path. Shell commands,
generators, human edits, external processes, and provider activity YA did not
observe may remain unattributed. An unobserved writer can also replace or
revert an observed session's contribution while leaving the path dirty, so a
recorded session can remain as a stale candidate until the path next becomes
clean. This limitation is accepted to bound implementation effort. UI wording
must therefore say **sessions with recorded edits**, not claim to identify
everyone who contributed to the file's current contents or present the set as
exhaustive.

Implementation plan:

1. Characterize each supported provider's structured file-mutation events and
   success boundary. Ignore failed or merely proposed mutations.
2. Persist a set whose logical rows are
   `(source, project, normalized file, canonical YA session, latest edit time)`.
   A later successful structured mutation by the same session to the same file
   only replaces that row's time; do not retain an event history, tool/message
   ids, content hashes, or before/after lineage. Private server-owned state
   survives restart and has no time-based or bounded-retention expiry.
3. Clear rows only when a successful complete Git-status refresh authoritatively
   observes the path clean. Restart and reconnect reconcile reachable projects;
   temporary disconnect retains rows, while explicit project/source removal
   clears the removed scope. A commit that leaves additional staged or unstaged
   changes does not clear anything.
4. Add a capability-gated query for the remaining candidate session summaries,
   ordered by each session's latest recorded edit, then reuse the existing
   session hovercard/navigation and source file banner/menu surfaces. More than
   one candidate opens the chooser; one candidate may navigate directly.
5. Test one and several sessions, repeated edits deduplicating to the latest
   time, failed edits being ignored, clean-state clearing, restart and
   disconnect/reconnect reconciliation, explicit removal, a commit that leaves
   the file dirty, and accepted missing/stale attribution after unobserved
   shell or human changes.

**Difficulty:** the button and chooser are low difficulty. Provider mutation
hooks, clean-state observation, the small tuple set, and its query are
low-to-medium difficulty. Content hashes, transcript backfill, exact lineage,
and exhaustive attribution are deliberately out of scope; writers that bypass
observable structured mutations are an accepted accuracy limit, not a reason
to enlarge the first implementation.

### Desktop pane splitters

At the desktop three-pane threshold, Commits exposes revision/files and
files/diff boundaries; Changes and Files expose their one files/detail
boundary. Each boundary has matching top and bottom separators with the same
current value. Dragging either handle dynamically reflows the owning CSS grid
and shows one vertical guide for the duration; keyboard Left/Right adjusts in
small steps and Home/End reaches the allowed extrema. No splitter markup
participates in phone layout. Width changes last for the mounted browser;
they are not a new persisted preference. — Done (2026-07-28).

The current file-pane implementation's fixed 500 px maximum is an arbitrary
implementation bound, not a product contract. A future full-width correction
should let the user widen the complete changed-files column until the
inter-pane gap and splitter handles remain fully visible and operable; do not
reserve an arbitrary minimum detail-pane width. The user will naturally stop
after exposing as much of the paths as they need, and the still-visible
splitter is the recovery path from an extreme choice. A smaller
content-derived maximum is optional, not required: if added, compute it from
the widest untruncated row in the **complete file corpus**, including its
status/count/menu affordances, rather than only the currently mounted
vertical-scroll window. Recompute when the corpus or font, size, or spacing
metrics change.

### Hunk navigation + single diff toolbar row

- **Re-click advances hunks.** Clicking the already-selected file entry jumps
  the diff to the next hunk (wrapping at the end), in both "diff only" and
  "full context" modes.
- **"k of N" hunk indicator** in the diff toolbar beside the filename,
  tappable to advance to the next hunk.
- **One toolbar row.** The diff currently spends a second row inside the
  content on the full path + view-mode toggles; fold that content — filename,
  path, view toggles, hunk indicator, file actions — into the single
  pane-header toolbar row **when it fits** (responsive; the body sub-row is the
  fallback when it does not), so the diff content keeps that row.
- **`n` key** jumps to the next hunk when focus is not in a text input.

— Done (2026-07-26). The wide diff pane uses the single-row form; a narrow
mobile modal keeps the compact controls-row fallback beneath its path title.

### Dark-theme diff emphasis

Dark and Very Dark keep added/deleted whole-line backgrounds as subdued
semantic washes rather than saturated panels. The narrow `+` / `−` gutter
carries the stronger green/red emphasis, so change type stays scannable
without competing with syntax text. Auto follows the Dark treatment when the
system is dark; Light keeps its established whole-line intensity. In the
source browser, the sign is an authored gutter rather than the first ordinary
monospace character: its strong-color strip has a fixed width, separate inset
before the glyph and breathing room after the color divide, and a small
optical glyph shift that does not narrow the strip. The shared diff palette
still applies to source-browser and session-tool diffs. — Done (2026-07-26;
source-gutter refinement 2026-07-28).

### Master-detail use and touch-readable row identities

- **Wide Files opens useful detail.** Once the tracked-file list loads, Files
  selects the first visible file whenever there is no still-visible selection.
  Changing the filter therefore replaces a filtered-out selection instead of
  leaving a narrow list beside an unused detail canvas. Mobile stays
  deliberately list-first.
- **Touch rows preserve identity in layout.** At phone width, commit subjects
  and file paths may use a second line before clipping, with practical
  touch-target height and row separation. Desktop still carries title
  tooltips for incidental truncation, but touch does not depend on hover as
  its only recovery path.

— Done (2026-07-26).

### Commit message display

- Clicking the compact commit body opens the **verbatim original message**
  (subject + body, hard breaks preserved) with the exact author date/time in
  the detail pane, until a file is picked (`CommitMessageView`; mobile modal).
  The banner hash tooltips `sha + date/time`; newer/older jump is glyph-only
  (↑/↓), adjacent, at the banner's left edge nearest the list. — Done
  (a977f1f9).
- **Soft-reflow of the compact body.** The compact commit body reflows
  width-wrapped prose to its column while preserving *intentional* breaks,
  mirroring the AGENTS.md
  commit-wrap rule: "Wrap body prose manually at 71 columns — a visual rule,
  not greedy fill: preserve bullets, hanging indents, aligned continuations,
  short tables, and ASCII diagrams even when that leaves a short line." A break
  before a line is intentional (kept) when the line is blank, a
  `[spaces]* `/`-`/`•`/`N.` bullet, indented (hanging/ASCII), or short while its
  predecessor is also short (two consecutive lines of at most 50 characters,
  for compact tables and ASCII). Otherwise the line is a wrapped continuation
  and folds into the previous with a space. Render the result with
  `white-space: pre-wrap`. `reflowCommitMessage` owns that tested display
  projection; the verbatim view above remains the escape hatch. — Done
  (2026-07-27).

### Search completions + match tooltips — pending

- Focused commit/file search shows a **completions/hints dropdown** to the
  right of the input.
- While focused with matches, **float per-match tooltips** — `…context…` with
  the matched **substring bolded** — reusing the session incremental-search
  (Ctrl-R / Ctrl-S) hit presentation. Find and reuse that presentation, don't
  re-derive it.

— Pending.

### Fast client-side search index

Typing in either source-browser search must update at interactive speed. The
previous two paths failed in different ways:

- **Files lost coverage.** `/git/files` ran `git ls-files` and returned at
  most 2,000 paths; `BlameBrowser` then filters that client-side corpus and
  renders at most 500 matches. A path outside the first server slice cannot be
  found at all. Repositories in scope will have at most 10,000 committed files,
  so the client can own the complete filename-search corpus.
- **Commit delta search repeated expensive work.** After a 300 ms debounce,
  every changed query started a new server-side `git log -G` history scan. Live
  use has shown these scans taking more than a second, so typing feels like a
  sequence of cold searches rather than incremental search.

Contract:

1. **One complete client corpus, no per-keystroke git process.** Files mode
   fetches all tracked paths once and builds normalized search entries in the
   browser. Commit-delta search builds its client corpus/index on demand. Once
   a corpus is available, changing the query performs no network request and
   starts no git command.
2. **Incremental query evaluation.** Extending a query narrows the previous
   candidate set; edits and backspaces query an in-memory substring index
   (for example, a small trigram-to-entry map). Lowercasing/tokenization and
   match-context extraction happen when records enter the index, not again for
   every query.
3. **Persistent on the same device, incremental across repo updates.** Store
   the on-demand index in IndexedDB, versioned by project/source identity,
   index format, and the indexed git horizon. New commits append until the
   previous indexed ancestor; a rewritten history that no longer reaches that
   ancestor invalidates the affected commit segment. A changed tracked-file
   corpus replaces the small file index.
4. **Coverage and rendering are separate.** Windowing or paging may keep the
   DOM small, but every match in the indexed corpus remains addressable.
   A 500-row render window must never become a 500-file search ceiling. While
   a commit index is still building, the UI states the indexed horizon and
   progress rather than silently presenting partial results as complete.
5. **Client ownership is the requested boundary.** A future server-side cache
   could accelerate first use or share an index across devices, but that is
   explicitly not part of this proposal. The server may stream source records
   needed to build the index; it does not become the typing-time search engine
   or the persistent index owner.

Items 1, 2, 4, and 5 are implemented (2026-07-26): Files receives the complete
tracked-path corpus up to the stated 10,000-file product bound and normalizes
it once; Commit search requests the complete lightweight history plus bounded
changed-path/changed-line batches on demand. Prefix-query candidate sets update
as batches arrive, typing launches no `git log -G`, ordinary Commit paging is
not a search ceiling, and progress is explicit while history is indexing. The
commit index survives source-tab remounts for the browser lifetime.

Item 3 remains a proposal: persist the in-browser indexes in IndexedDB and
append/invalidate them from the prior git horizon. A cross-device server cache
remains a possible later first-use accelerator, not part of the requested
ownership boundary.

## Open questions

- **Provenance rendering.** Reuse the compose-time-context-anchors framing so
  each quote's SHA/age is legible to both the reader and the agent.
- **Dirty (uncommitted) comments may not be sufficiently contextualized.**
  A committed `sha:path:line` can be reopened exactly; a dirty-file anchor
  cannot. The saved timestamp, line number, and small snippet describe what the
  reviewer saw, but the file can drift between comment, submit, and the agent's
  eventual read. Submit-time relocation does not by itself preserve that
  original state.

  The implementation is currently weaker than this topic's earlier "fuzzy
  context-snippet match" wording: it exact-matches only the clicked line
  (ignoring trailing whitespace), chooses the occurrence nearest the recorded
  line, and refreshes the snippet from there. It neither scores the surrounding
  context nor reports an ambiguous repeated-line match. The composed turn then
  shows only the refreshed current snippet and a generic read-current-state
  instruction; it does not say that an uncommitted anchor moved, carry an
  identity for the dirty file version, or preserve original-versus-current
  context.

  Treat this as a stale-read discipline, analogous to the exact-preimage,
  context-anchor, and reject-on-staleness choices in
  [provider-read-edit-disciplines](provider-read-edit-disciplines.md). Before
  calling the concern closed, decide which stronger contract applies:
  preserve a content fingerprint plus the original context snapshot at comment
  time; relocate by scoring the full context and surface ambiguous/no-match
  outcomes instead of silently choosing nearest; and tell the submitted
  session when the anchor moved, with original and current context when they
  differ. A project-local snapshot/blob keyed by content hash is the strongest
  recoverable option, but is not yet chosen.
- **Review-file/draft-file split.** Whether the seeded prompt references
  `.yep/review-comments.json` directly or a per-submit snapshot beside it,
  and how a follow-up turn's update composes with the archive. How archived
  comments are pruned.
- **Relationship to forged-transcript-handoff.** A submitted review is a
  narrower, reviewer-authored cousin of that experiment — worth deciding whether
  they share the seeding path.
- **Disposition round-trip (aspirational, no mechanism decided).** Submitting
  a batch archives its comments — "handled" from the reviewer's side — but
  the agent's actual outcomes never flow back. The seeded prompt already
  instructs the agent to report a per-comment disposition
  (done / won't-fix / question) in its reply; nothing captures that onto the
  archived comments. The aspiration: each archived comment shows a one-line
  disposition in the comments view, beside its batch/session link, so
  "submitted" and "actually resolved" stop being conflated. Feasible shape:
  the bundled review message additionally instructs the agent to emit an
  explicitly parseable per-comment-id disposition line (or call a small
  server endpoint/tool), and the server attaches what it sees to the archived
  comment. Nothing is committed — the prompt-side instruction, the capture
  channel, and the rendering are all open.

## Staged plan (historical)

Written before implementation; retained as the record of how the work
was cut. Stages 1-3 and P8 are landed — see Status at top.

1. **One-off line comment → new session.** Add click-a-diff-line → comment on
   the git-status/diff viewer — which is the working-tree diff, so this slice
   already exercises the `uncommitted` anchor class. Built as the single-entry
   accumulator drained immediately (per the fast-path definition above), it
   proves the line-anchor + provenance payload with no parallel code path.
2. **Accumulating review — the vision.** Persist pending comments in the
   server-owned `.yep/review-comments.json` across files and commits with a
   visible count; "submit review" runs the preview (stale comments
   pre-selected discard), drains the survivors into the target session
   (recent review session by default, override to any or new), and archives
   them consumed.
3. **Fuller multipane viewer + all-files blame + search + mobile.** Wrap the flow
   in the large-screen multipane commit/diff/file viewer with the copy
   affordances, the all-files git-blame browsing mode, rudimentary
   commit-delta/filename search, the unified/side-by-side diff view mode
   (orderable independently — it touches only the existing diff viewer),
   and the mobile back-swipe + commit-jump path.

## Implementation sketch (historical implementer guide)

Verified against the tree at a682f7c3, before the implementation
landed; it describes the pre-implementation tree, not current code.

Verified against the tree at a682f7c3 (2026-07-26); file references are real,
nothing below is built. This is the concrete shape for stages 1–2.

### What exists to build on

- Route `/git-status` → `packages/client/src/pages/GitStatusPage.tsx`
  (~1450 lines — already large; every new pane below is a new file composed
  into it, never inline growth).
- `pages/GitStatusDiffPreview.tsx` fetches
  `api.getGitDiff(projectId, { path, staged, status, fullContext? })` →
  `GitDiffResult` and renders `diffResult.diffHtml` — server-generated Shiki
  HTML — via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (`HighlightedDiff`), with a per-line
  `DiffLines` fallback when highlighting was skipped.
- The diff HTML's lines already carry classes
  `line line-deleted|line-inserted|line-context|line-hunk`, added at
  generation time by `addDiffLineClasses`
  (`packages/server/src/augments/edit-augments.ts`).
- `GitDiffResult.structuredPatch: PatchHunk[]`
  (`packages/shared/src/types.ts:736`): `oldStart`/`newStart` plus
  `' '|'-'|'+'`-prefixed `lines` — per-side line numbers are computable by
  walking hunks; no DOM needed.
- Server JSON-persistence idiom: `PushService`
  (`packages/server/src/push/PushService.ts`) — typed state, load once,
  debounced save — is the template for the drafts service.
- Session plumbing: two-phase `api.createSession(projectId, opts)` +
  `POST /sessions/{id}/messages`; server-side, the supervisor and
  project-queue already create sessions and deliver first turns.

### Consequential decisions

1. **Anchors derive from `structuredPatch`, never from the DOM.** A click
   identifies (hunk index, line index); a pure shared helper computes side,
   old/new line numbers, and the context snippet from `PatchHunk` data. The
   Shiki HTML stays presentation-only, so anchor logic is testable without a
   browser and cannot drift from what is displayed.
2. **Line clicks: server-emitted indices + one delegated listener; no DOM
   patching.** Extend `addDiffLineClasses` to also emit
   `data-diff-line="<flat line index>"` at generation time; the diff pane
   attaches a single click handler on the `.highlighted-diff` container that
   walks to the nearest `[data-diff-line]`. Per-line React components would
   abandon server highlighting; attaching handlers by post-processing the
   injected HTML would patch generated DOM (the
   [ui-architecture](ui-architecture.md) rule). Give the `DiffLines` fallback
   the same attribute so one handler serves both renderers. The
   comment-anchor tint ([selection-comment-ui](selection-comment-ui.md)) is a
   class toggled on nodes addressed by that same server-emitted attribute —
   idempotent decoration of stably-addressed nodes, not restructuring.
3. **Wire types in `packages/shared` with a defensive parser.**
   `shared/src/review-comments.ts`: `ReviewCommentAnchor` (path; anchoring
   revision `sha | { uncommitted: true, savedAt }`; side; old/new line;
   snippet), `ReviewComment` (id, anchor, text, `pending | archived`, batch +
   target-session link). Parse persisted data defensively (the
   `parseClaudeAdditionalModelSelections` idiom): `.yep/review-comments.json`
   outlives bundle versions and is user-visible on disk, so the shape is a
   contract from day 1.
4. **One review service owns the file.**
   `packages/server/src/review/ReviewCommentService.ts` (PushService shape)
   reads/writes `{projectPath}/.yep/review-comments.json`: comment CRUD,
   pending→archived transitions, batch records. Routes in a new
   `packages/server/src/routes/review-comments.ts` — `routes/git-status.ts`
   is 1200 lines and must not absorb this feature.
5. **Submit is one server endpoint; preview is its dry run.**
   `POST /api/projects/:projectId/review/preview` relocates every pending
   anchor (exact line match against HEAD/worktree, then fuzzy snippet match,
   git plumbing) and returns per-comment `{ relocated | gone }` for the
   discard-default preview.
   `POST …/review/submit { include, target: "new" | sessionId }` re-runs
   relocation, composes the short prompt referencing the review file, creates
   the session (supervisor) or posts the follow-up turn, archives the batch
   with its target, and returns the session id for the client to navigate to.
   The client stays dumb: render preview, confirm, navigate. Relocation and
   turn composition are pure modules (`review/relocateAnchors.ts`,
   `review/composeReviewTurn.ts`) with the endpoint as thin glue.
6. **Stage 1 cuts scope by count, not by shape.** The one-off fast path is
   the same service, file, and submit endpoint with a single pending comment
   and no preview UI — relocation is trivially exact because the anchor is
   seconds old. No client-side storage variant exists at any stage.
7. **Side-by-side is a client arrangement of once-highlighted lines.** Today
   `diffHtml` is one Shiki block; side-by-side must not become a second
   server render that can drift from the first. When the diff pane grows the
   view mode, the render unit becomes per-line highlighted fragments (the
   line elements `addDiffLineClasses` already produces), and the client
   arranges them — unified as a stack, side-by-side as a two-column pairing
   whose `-`/`+` run alignment is computed from `structuredPatch` (pure
   data, same source as anchors). The `data-diff-line` click/tint contract
   addresses lines, not the container, so it survives both layouts
   unchanged; a left-column click is a `-`-side anchor, a right-column click
   `+`-side. The `auto` default measures the pane per the diff-view-mode
   decision; the in-pane toggle persists device-locally. This piece touches
   only the existing diff viewer, so it can land independently of stages
   1–2.

### Tests that pin the contract

- Anchor-from-patch helper: hunk walking yields correct old/new line numbers
  at boundaries (first/last line of a hunk, context vs `-`/`+` lines).
- Parser: round-trip of persisted comments; garbage and truncated files
  reject to empty rather than throwing.
- Relocation, against a fixture repo: unchanged line → relocated; moved line
  → fuzzy-relocated; deleted line → gone (SHA cited); an `uncommitted`
  anchor whose change has since been committed acquires that commit's SHA.
- Service: per-project isolation (two projects never mix), pending→archived
  lifecycle, a batch records its target session, archive survives service
  restart.
- Compose: SHA appears only for gone/minus-side comments; from-X-to-Y
  framing carries both sides; comments group by file; the
  read-current-state instruction is present in every prompt.
- Client (RTL): clicking a `.line-inserted` node in rendered `diffHtml`
  opens the comment window with the correct anchor; a commented line shows
  the tint; the preview lists gone-context comments first, pre-selected
  discard (mocked preview API).
- View mode (with stage 3): `auto` resolves unified when the pane measures
  below two readable columns and side-by-side above; a manual pick wins over
  `auto` and survives reload; in side-by-side, a left-column click anchors
  `-`-side and a right-column click `+`-side.

### Subtask phases (each lands green)

Stages 1–2 decompose into subtask-sized phases, each verifiable by its own
tests before the next begins. Every phase before P6 is user-invisible, so no
half-built UI ever ships; P6 is the first visible milestone (= stage 1).

- **P1 — anchor model (shared).** Types + defensive parser +
  anchor-from-patch helper. Verified by unit tests alone (hunk-boundary line
  numbers, round-trip, garbage rejection). Land paired with P2 or P3 so the
  contract module does not sit consumerless.
- **P2 — line addressing (server).** `addDiffLineClasses` emits
  `data-diff-line` matching the flat `structuredPatch` index. Verified by
  augment unit tests asserting index↔line agreement; invisible in the UI,
  safe alone.
- **P3 — drafts service + CRUD routes (server).** `ReviewCommentService`
  over `.yep/review-comments.json` plus `routes/review-comments.ts` CRUD.
  Verified by route tests (per-project isolation, lifecycle, restart
  survival) and by curl against a dev-profile instance.
- **P4 — compose + relocation (server, pure).** `composeReviewTurn` and
  `relocateAnchors` as pure modules with fixture-repo tests
  (SHA-only-when-gone, moved/gone/committed-uncommitted cases). No routes
  yet.
- **P5 — preview + submit endpoints.** Thin glue over P3 + P4 plus the
  supervisor launch. Route tests with a stubbed supervisor; one real
  single-comment submit against a dev-profile instance closes the stage-1
  backend.
- **P6 — click → comment window → submit-now (client).** Delegated
  listener, `CommentWindow`, tint, submit-now button. RTL tests; the
  stage-1 user-visible milestone.
- **P7 — pending tray + submit preview + target picker (client).** RTL
  tests for discard-default ordering and the recent-review-session default;
  the stage-2 milestone.
- **P8 — diff view mode.** Independent of all of the above (decision 7);
  orderable any time.

Dependencies: P1 → {P2, P3, P4}; P5 needs P3 + P4; P6 needs P2 + P5; P7
needs P5 (and P6's window for editing). P2/P3/P4 parallelize after P1.
