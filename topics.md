  composers (New Session chip, floating composer chip; the session-composer
  float was removed as redundant with the header badge).

  read-only external provider process discovery for Agents.

  opinionated template, committed project files, registry, icon links,
  YA-server-only reach (relay core, with optional globally configured
  Tailscale and Cloudflare paths), and a meta-UI comment-to-agent channel.
- rich-interviews - Banked: multi-round structured-input interview flows;
  YA renders declared formats inline; revisit atop interactives machinery.
- server-plugin-arch - Banked no: settings-gated loadable server plugins;
  monolith convenience wins absent a contributing community.
- project-settings-overrides - Banked seed: project-scoped settings
  overriding global; easy mechanically, painful to visualize; no current use.
- composer-recall-drawer - Ctrl+Up prefix-match history drawer folding up
  from the composer (reuses isearch/UserTurnNavigator machinery); bundled
  enablement change makes !! execution and the recall drawer always-on,
  with only the "!! Commands" sidebar section opt-in. Vanilla Defaults
  amended with an established-convention carve-out to allow it.
- composer-input-latency - Session composer typing stays local regardless of
  transcript size; quote and queued-edit consumers subscribe below the
  transcript boundary, while reactive browser preferences use cached
  snapshots and draft-presence decoration is event-driven.

  SettingsItem/SettingsSection row layer, operable-in-place results with
  highlighted matches and jump links, default-off "Match values" toggle.
- source-review-to-session - Read-only source review comments accumulated into
  a new agent session; issue #95's broader source manager is inspiration only.
- conversation-view - Opt-in condensed transcript preserving user/agent text,
  images, and failures behind per-turn expandable elapsed/activity summaries.
- acli-ui - ACLI capability detection (`acli:` help line) and richer
  bang-composer completion/help UI proposal.
- ui-testing - Capture-confirmed browser QA: UI tweak requests end with
  inspected 1920x1080 + phone captures of the result.
- source-control - Repository-navigation workbench: changes, commits, files,
  blame, diffs, responsive panes, and links to relevant agent sessions.
